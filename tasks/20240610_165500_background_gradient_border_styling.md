# Task: Gradient Border Styling Refinement

**Status**: Completed

## Analysis

- [x] Requirements
  - [x] Match the gradient border style of the GitHub card shown in the reference image
  - [x] Ensure a consistent purple hue that fades from top to bottom
  - [x] Maintain proper dark background for content
- [x] Challenges
  - [x] Achieving precise gradient fade matching the reference image
  - [x] Balancing border visibility while maintaining subtle effect
- [x] Dependencies
  - [x] Existing BackgroundGradient component

## Plan

- [x] Step 1: Review the current implementation
  - [x] Analyze existing gradient colors and opacity values
  - [x] Compare with reference image for differences
- [x] Step 2: Adjust color and gradient parameters
  - [x] Modify gradient colors to match the purple hue
  - [x] Fine-tune opacity values for natural fade
  - [x] Ensure proper background color for inner content
- [x] Step 3: Optimize hover effects
  - [x] Refine blur and opacity transitions on hover
  - [x] Test with different content types

## Execution

- [x] Modify gradient parameters
  - [x] Update gradient direction and opacity stops
  - [x] Simplify to single-color fade for consistency
- [x] Adjust container styles
  - [x] Set proper padding for border thickness
  - [x] Ensure rounded corners match reference
- [x] Test and refine
  - [x] Compare implementation with reference image
  - [x] Make final adjustments to achieve exact match

## Summary

- [x] Files modified: `src/frontend/src/components/ui/background-gradient.tsx`
- [x] Dependencies added/changed: None
- [x] Edge cases considered: Different screen sizes, container dimensions
- [x] Known limitations: Exact color reproduction may vary slightly based on monitor calibration
- [x] Future impact points: Component can be reused across the application for consistent styling

### Implementation Details

1. Changed the gradient to a simpler purple fade from top to bottom
2. Used opacity values of 0.7 at top and 0.3 at bottom for subtle fade
3. Reduced border thickness to 2px with `p-[2px]`
4. Made the hover effect more subtle with `opacity-60` instead of `opacity-100`
5. Changed blur on hover from `blur-lg` to `blur-md` for a less intense glow
