# Response for Issue #9055: Embedded Chatbot External JavaScript Security Risk

Hi @flefevre,

Thank you for reporting this important security concern regarding the embedded chatbot's dependency on external CDN resources. This is a legitimate security issue that affects enterprise deployments and regulated environments.

## Issue Validation

I've confirmed the following through codebase analysis:

1. **CDN Hardcoding Confirmed**: The file `src/frontend/src/modals/apiModal/utils/get-widget-code.tsx` (lines 16-17) hardcodes the CDN reference to:
   ```javascript
   src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/logspace-ai/langflow-embedded-chat@v1.0.7/dist/build/static/js/bundle.min.js"
   ```

2. **Security Impact Validated**: Your concerns are legitimate:
   - **CSP Violations**: External CDN scripts violate strict Content Security Policy rules
   - **Supply Chain Risk**: CDN compromise could inject malicious code
   - **Air-gapped Incompatibility**: External dependencies block deployment in isolated networks
   - **Audit Compliance**: External uncontrolled scripts fail security audits in regulated industries

3. **Related Issue**: This relates to your earlier report in issue #8854, confirming this is a persistent concern

## Technical Architecture

Langflow already has the infrastructure to support local hosting:
- FastAPI with `StaticFiles` mounting capability exists in `main.py`
- Static file serving is already implemented for the frontend application
- The architecture can support serving the embedded chat bundle locally

## Immediate Workaround

Until this is addressed in the core product, you can:

1. **Download the bundle**: Fetch the bundle from the CDN and host it locally
2. **Modify the integration code**: Point to your local hosting instead of the CDN
3. **Use a reverse proxy**: Set up a proxy to serve the bundle from your infrastructure

## Development Team Action Required

This requires core changes to the embedding system:
- Modifying the widget code generation to support local paths
- Including the embedded chat bundle in Langflow's static files
- Ensuring version compatibility between Langflow and the embedded chat

As requested, this needs attention from @italojohnny and @Cristhianzl for implementation.

## Recommended Solution Path

1. **Bundle Integration**: Include `langflow-embedded-chat` bundle in Langflow's static directory
2. **Dynamic Path Generation**: Update `get-widget-code.tsx` to use relative/local paths
3. **Configuration Option**: Allow users to choose between CDN and local hosting
4. **SRI Support**: Add Subresource Integrity hashes for CDN option if retained

This enhancement would enable secure deployment in enterprise and regulated environments while maintaining ease of use for standard deployments.

Best regards,
