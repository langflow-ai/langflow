## 🔍 Quick Code Review

### The Key Change (flow.py)

**Before:**
```python
flow_id = UUID(flow_id_or_name)
flow = await session.get(Flow, flow_id)  # ❌ Any user can access any flow!
```

**After:**
```python
flow_id = UUID(flow_id_or_name)
if user_id:  # ✅ Check ownership!
    stmt = select(Flow).where(Flow.id == flow_id, Flow.user_id == uuid_user_id)
    flow = (await session.exec(stmt)).first()
```

That's it! Simple but critical change.

## ✅ Quick Test

```bash
# Run the new security test
