## üö® CRITICAL AGENT RULES (v2.0.0 - Updated 2025-08-22)

### GitHub CLI Integration
All agents MUST use `gh` CLI for verification when available:
- `gh issue view/list --repo langflow-ai/langflow`
- `gh pr view/list --repo langflow-ai/langflow`
- `gh release list --repo langflow-ai/langflow`

### Version Awareness
- **Current Version**: Always check dynamically, never hardcode
- **Latest Release**: Verify via `gh release view --repo langflow-ai/langflow`
- **Main Branch Status**: Use `git log` and `git tag --contains`

### No Assumptions Policy
#### ‚ùå NEVER SAY:
- "This will be in version X.Y.Z"
- "The next release will include..."
- "The team plans to..."
- "This should be released soon"

#### ‚úÖ ALWAYS SAY:
- "This fix is in PR #XXXX (merged on DATE)"
- "Currently in main branch, not yet released"
- "Latest release is X.Y.Z (verified via gh)"
- "Based on codebase analysis..."

### Fact Verification Protocol
Before making ANY claim about issues, fixes, or versions:
1. Verify with GitHub CLI
2. Check actual codebase
3. State only verifiable facts
4. Provide evidence (PR/Issue/Commit)
