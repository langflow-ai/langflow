## 📁 Files Changed

### Modified Files
1. **`src/backend/base/langflow/helpers/flow.py`**
   - Fixed `get_flow_by_id_or_endpoint_name()` to validate user ownership for UUID lookups
   - Added security check: `WHERE Flow.id = flow_id AND Flow.user_id = user_id`

2. **`src/backend/base/langflow/api/v1/endpoints.py`**
   - Updated `/api/v1/run/{flow_id_or_name}` endpoint to pass user_id
   - Updated `/api/v1/webhook/{flow_id_or_name}` endpoint to pass user_id
   - Removed unsafe dependency injection pattern

### Added Files
3. **`src/backend/tests/unit/test_api_key_cross_account_security.py`** (NEW)
   - Comprehensive security test suite
   - Tests cross-account blocking
   - Tests legitimate access still works

4. **`SECURITY_FIX_10202.md`** (NEW)
   - Detailed technical documentation
   - Root cause analysis
   - Security implications

5. **`PR_DESCRIPTION.md`** (NEW)
   - Pull request description
   - Testing instructions
   - Review guidelines

## 🔍 What Was Fixed

### Before (Vulnerable)
```python
# User A creates API key: sk-user-a-123
# User B creates flow: flow-b-456

# User A tries to run User B's flow:
curl -X POST /api/v1/run/flow-b-456 \
  -H "x-api-key: sk-user-a-123"

# Response: 200 OK ❌ (SECURITY BUG!)
# User A could execute User B's flow!
```

### After (Secure)
```python
# Same scenario:
curl -X POST /api/v1/run/flow-b-456 \
  -H "x-api-key: sk-user-a-123"

# Response: 404 Not Found ✅ (SECURE!)
# User A cannot access User B's flow
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Automated Tests Added
```bash
# Run security tests
pytest src/backend/tests/unit/test_api_key_cross_account_security.py -v

# All tests pass ✅
```

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Cross-account access is blocked (404 error)
- ✅ Same-account access still works (200 OK)
- ✅ Flow retrieval protected
- ✅ Webhook endpoints secured

---

## 🚀 Impact

### Security Impact
- ✅ **HIGH:** Prevents unauthorized cross-account access
- ✅ **Data Protection:** Users can only access their own flows
- ✅ **Privacy:** No information leakage about other users' flows

### User Impact
- ✅ **No Breaking Changes:** Legitimate use cases continue to work
- ✅ **Transparent:** Users won't notice any difference in normal usage
- ✅ **Improved Security:** Better protection of user data

### Performance Impact
- ✅ **Minimal:** One additional WHERE clause in SQL query
- ✅ **No Noticeable Overhead:** Query performance unchanged

## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **Always validate ownership** when accessing user-specific resources
2. **Check all code paths** - vulnerability existed in UUID path but not endpoint name path
3. **Test negative cases** - ensure unauthorized access is properly blocked
4. **Defense in depth** - multiple layers of security checks are valuable

---

## 🔐 Security Best Practices Applied

1. ✅ **Principle of Least Privilege** - Users can only access their own resources
2. ✅ **Fail Securely** - Returns 404 instead of revealing flow existence
3. ✅ **Defense in Depth** - Multiple validation layers
4. ✅ **Secure by Default** - Security enabled for all flows
5. ✅ **No Information Leakage** - Same error for "doesn't exist" vs "no access"
