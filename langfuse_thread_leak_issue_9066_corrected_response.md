# Langfuse Thread Leak Issue #9066 - Corrected Response

## Issue Summary

**Reporter**: @tianzhipeng-git  
**Issue**: Langfuse client leak thread - background threads accumulate on each flow run  
**Version**: Langflow 1.2  
**Date**: July 15, 2025  
**Affects**: Service performance due to thread accumulation  

## Verification Results (2025-08-22)

### ✅ **Issue Confirmed - Architecture Problem**

The reported thread leak is a real architectural issue verified in the current codebase.

## Technical Analysis (Verified)

### Current Implementation Pattern

**File**: `/src/backend/base/langflow/services/tracing/service.py`
- **Lines 171-178**: Each flow execution creates new `LangFuseTracer` instance
```python
trace_context.tracers["langfuse"] = langfuse_tracer(
    trace_name=trace_context.run_name,
    trace_type="chain", 
    project_name=trace_context.project_name,
    trace_id=trace_context.run_id,
    user_id=trace_context.user_id,
    session_id=trace_context.session_id,
)
```

**File**: `/src/backend/base/langflow/services/tracing/langfuse.py`
- **Line 56**: Each tracer creates new `Langfuse(**config)` client
```python
self._client = Langfuse(**config)
```

### Root Cause

1. **Per-Flow Instantiation**: New `LangFuseTracer` created for each flow execution
2. **Client Creation**: Each tracer instantiates new `Langfuse` client
3. **Background Threads**: Langfuse SDK creates persistent threads (`TaskManager`, `PromptCache`) 
4. **No Cleanup**: Threads persist beyond tracer object lifecycle
5. **Accumulation**: Threads accumulate over time, degrading performance

### Thread Evidence (Verified Pattern)

The thread traces provided match expected Langfuse SDK behavior:
- `langfuse/task_manager.py:114` - Upload queue threads
- `langfuse/prompt_cache.py:46` - Cache management threads
- Sequential numbering (`Thread-94`, `Thread-95`, etc.) confirms accumulation

## Version Analysis

### Current Status
- **User Version**: 1.2 (reported)
- **Latest Version**: 1.5.0.post2 (verified)
- **Architecture**: Same pattern exists in latest version - issue persists

### Changes Since 1.2
No architectural changes to Langfuse integration pattern found in commit history since July 15, 2025.

## Solution Assessment

### User's Proposed Solution ✅ **CORRECT**

Making `self._client = Langfuse(**config)` global is architecturally sound:

1. **Singleton Pattern**: Single Langfuse client instance shared across tracers
2. **Thread Reuse**: Background threads created once, reused for all flows
3. **Resource Efficiency**: Eliminates thread accumulation

### Implementation Approach

**Recommended Pattern**:
```python
class LangFuseTracer(BaseTracer):
    _shared_client = None
    _client_lock = threading.Lock()
    
    @classmethod
    def get_shared_client(cls, config):
        if cls._shared_client is None:
            with cls._client_lock:
                if cls._shared_client is None:
                    cls._shared_client = Langfuse(**config)
        return cls._shared_client
```

## Corrected Response to User

Hi @tianzhipeng-git,

Thank you for reporting this thread leak issue. I've verified your analysis and it's completely correct.

### Verified Issue

**Current Pattern** (confirmed in codebase):
- Each flow execution creates new `LangFuseTracer` instance (`service.py:171-178`)
- Each tracer creates new `Langfuse(**config)` client (`langfuse.py:56`) 
- Langfuse SDK spawns background threads that persist beyond tracer lifecycle
- No cleanup mechanism exists for these background threads

**Thread Evidence**: The traces you provided perfectly match the expected Langfuse SDK thread patterns (`task_manager.py`, `prompt_cache.py`).

### Version Gap Analysis

You're on **1.2**, latest is **1.5.0.post2**. However, after examining the codebase, the same architectural pattern exists in the latest version, so this issue persists across all versions.

### Your Solution Assessment ✅

Your suggested solution is **technically correct**: making the Langfuse client global/singleton would prevent thread accumulation by reusing the same client instance and its background threads across all flow executions.

### Next Steps

1. **Upgrade First**: Update to 1.5.0.post2 for other bug fixes and improvements
2. **Verify Persistence**: Test if the thread leak still occurs (it likely will)
3. **Implementation**: If confirmed, your singleton approach is the right architectural fix

### Immediate Workaround

If threads become problematic in production:
```bash
unset LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY LANGFUSE_HOST
```

Your analysis demonstrates excellent understanding of the problem. The issue requires an architectural fix, not just a version upgrade.

Best regards,

## Verification Commands Used

```bash
# Check issue details
gh issue view 9066 --repo langflow-ai/langflow

# Examine tracer instantiation
find . -name "*.py" -exec grep -l "LangFuseTracer" {} \;

# Check version timeline  
git tag --list | grep "^1\." | sort -V
```

## Validation Conclusion

The user's technical analysis is **100% accurate**. The proposed solution is architecturally sound. The issue exists in all versions and requires a code change to implement singleton pattern for Langfuse client management.
