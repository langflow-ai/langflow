# Validated Response for Issue #9024: Docling Build Failed

Hi @brunorafaeI,

Thank you for reporting this Docling issue. I've identified the root cause and have both immediate workarounds and information about the permanent fix.

## Analysis

This is a confirmed bug in Langflow 1.5.0.post1 when using Docling components with Docker deployments. The issue has multiple phases:

1. **Installation Error**: The Docker image doesn't include Docling by default
2. **Memory/SIGKILL Errors**: After installation, worker processes crash due to improper process isolation during Docling model loading

The good news is that this has been **fixed in PR #9393** (merged August 20, 2025) and **will be available in the next release after 1.5.0.post2**.

## Immediate Solutions

### Option 1: Docker Runtime Installation (Temporary)
For quick testing, install Docling directly in the running container:

1. Start your Langflow Docker container:
```bash
docker run -p 7860:7860 langflowai/langflow:latest
```

2. Access the container terminal:
```bash
docker exec -it <container_id> bash
```

3. Install Docling:
```bash
uv pip install docling
```

4. Restart the container and try your flow again

**Note**: This installation will be lost when the container is recreated.

### Option 2: Custom Docker Image (Permanent)
Create a custom Dockerfile for persistent Docling support:

```dockerfile
FROM langflowai/langflow:latest

# Install Docling
RUN uv pip install docling

EXPOSE 7860
CMD ["langflow", "run"]
```

Build and run:
```bash
docker build -t langflow-docling .
docker run -p 7860:7860 langflow-docling
```

### Option 3: Manual Fix (Advanced)
If you need the fix immediately, you can manually apply the changes from [PR #9393](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow/pull/9393/files) to your installation.

## Memory/Performance Considerations

The SIGKILL errors you and other users experienced are due to:
- Heavy memory usage during Docling model initialization
- Insufficient process isolation in the current version
- Docker container memory limits

**For better performance:**
- Ensure your Docker container has adequate memory (minimum 4GB recommended for Docling)
- Consider increasing Docker memory limits if using Docker Desktop:
```bash
docker run -m 4g -p 7860:7860 langflow-docling
```

## Permanent Fix Timeline

The complete fix is **already merged** and consists of:
- **[PR #9393](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow/pull/9393)** (August 20, 2025): Isolates Docling processing in separate worker processes
- **[PR #9469](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow/pull/9469)** (August 22, 2025): Optimizes Docker builds and dependencies
- **[PR #9398](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow/pull/9398)** (August 22, 2025): Adds advanced parsing features

These fixes will be included in the **next Langflow release** (after 1.5.0.post2). The fix properly isolates Docling processing in separate worker processes, preventing the memory issues and crashes.
