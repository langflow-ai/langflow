The **Run Flow** component runs another Langflow flow as a subprocess of the current flow.

You can use this component to chain flows together, run flows conditionally, and attach flows to [**Agent** components](/components-agents) as [tools for agents](/agents-tools) to run as needed.

When used with an agent, the `name` and `description` metadata that the agent uses to register the tool are created automatically.

When you select a flow for the **Run Flow** component, it uses the target flow's graph structure to dynamically generate input and output fields on the **Run Flow** component.
