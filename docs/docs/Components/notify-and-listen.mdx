The **Notify** and **Listen** components are used together.

The **Notify** component builds a notification from the current flow's context, including specific data content and a status identifier.

The resulting notification is sent to the **Listen** component.
The notification data can then be passed to other components in the flow, such as the [**If-Else** component](/if-else).
