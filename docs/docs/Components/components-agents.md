# Agent components in Langflow

Agent components define the behavior and capabilities of AI agents in your flow.

Agents use LLMs as a reasoning engine to decide which of the connected tool components to use to solve a problem.

Tools in agentic functions are essentially functions that the agent can call to perform tasks or access external resources.
A function is wrapped as a `Tool` object with a common interface the agent understands.
Agents become aware of tools through tool registration where the agent is provided a list of available tools typically at agent initialization. The `Tool` object's description tells the agent what the tool can do.

The agent then uses a connected LLM to reason through the problem to decide which tool is best for the job.

## Use an agent in a flow

The [simple agent starter project](/starter-projects-simple-agent) uses an [agent component](#agent-component) connected to URL and Calculator tools to answer a user's questions. The OpenAI LLM acts as a brain for the agent to decide which tool to use. Tools are connected to agent components at the **Tools** port.

For a multi-agent example see, [Create a problem-solving agent](/agents-tool-calling-agent-component).

## Agent component {#agent-component}

This component creates an agent that can use tools to answer questions and perform tasks based on given instructions.

The component includes an LLM model integration, a system message prompt, and a **Tools** port to connect tools to extend its capabilities.

For more information on this component, see the [tool calling agent documentation](/agents-tool-calling-agent-component).
