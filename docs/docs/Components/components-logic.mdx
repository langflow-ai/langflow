Langflow's logic components provide functionalities for routing, conditional processing, and flow management.

## If-Else (conditional router) {#if-else}

The **If-Else** component is a conditional router that routes messages by comparing two strings.
It evaluates a condition by comparing two text inputs using the specified operator, and then routes the message to `true_result` or `false_result` depending on the evaluation.

The operator looks for single strings in the input (`input_text`) based on an operator and match text (`match_text`), but it can also search for multiple words by matching a regex.
Available operators include:

- **equals**: Exact match comparison
- **not equals**: Inverse of exact match
- **contains**: Checks if the `match_text` is found within `input_text`
- **starts with**: Checks if `input_text` begins with `match_text`
- **ends with**: Checks if `input_text` ends with `match_text`
- **regex**: Matches on a case sensitive regular expression

By default, all operators are case insensitive except **regex**.
**regex** is always case sensitive, and you can enable case sensitivity for all other operators in the [If-Else parameters](#if-else-parameters).

### Use the If-Else component in a flow

The following example uses the **If-Else** component to check incoming chat messages with regex matching, and then output a different response depending on whether the match evaluated to true or false.

![A conditional router connected to two OpenAI components](/img/component-conditional-router.png)

1. Add an **If-Else** component to your flow, and then configure it as follows:

    * **Text Input**: Connect the **Text Input** port to a **Chat Input** component.

    * **Match Text**: Enter `.*(urgent|warning|caution).*` so the component looks for these values in incoming input. The regex match is case sensitive, so if you need to look for all permutations of `warning`, enter `warning|Warning|WARNING`.

    * **Operator**: Select **regex**. For more operators, see [Operator behavior](#operator-behavior).

    * **Case True**: In the [component's header menu](/concepts-components#component-menus), click <Icon name="SlidersHorizontal" aria-hidden="true"/> **Controls**, enable the **Case True** parameter, click **Close**, and then enter `New Message Detected` in the field.

        The **Case True** message is sent from the **True** output port when the match condition evaluates to true.

        No message is set for **Case False** so the component doesn't emit a message when the condition evaluates to false.

3. Depending on what you want to happen when the outcome is **True**, add components to your flow to execute that logic:

    1. Add a **Language Model**, **Prompt Template**, and **Chat Output** component to your flow.

    2. In the **Language Model** component, enter your OpenAI API key or select a different provider and model.

    3. Connect the **If-Else** component's **True** output port to the **Language Model** component's **Input** port.

    4. In the **Prompt Template** component, enter a prompt to instruct the model in the event of the `true` condition, such as `Send a message that a new warning, caution, or urgent message was received`.

    5. Connect the **Prompt Template** component to the **Language Model** component's **System Message** port.

    6. Connect the **Language Model** component's output to the **Chat Output** component.

4. Repeat the same process with another set of **Language Model**, **Prompt Template**, and **Chat Output** components for the **False** outcome.

    Connect the **If-Else** component's **False** output port to the second **Language Model** component's **Input** port.

    Be sure to configure the second **Prompt Template** component to instruct the model in the event of the `false` condition, such as `Send a message that a new low-priority message was received`.

5. To test the flow, open the **Playground**, and then send the flow some messages with and without your regex strings.
The chat output should reflect the instructions in your prompts based on the regex evaluation.

    ```text
    User: A new user was created.

    AI: A new low-priority message was received.

    User: Sign-in warning: new user locked out.

    AI: A new warning, caution, or urgent message was received. Please review it at your earliest convenience.
    ```

### If-Else parameters

Some **If-Else** component input parameters are hidden by default in the visual editor.
You can toggle parameters through the <Icon name="SlidersHorizontal" aria-hidden="true"/> **Controls** in each [component's header menu](/concepts-components#component-menus).

| Name           | Type     | Description                                                       |
|----------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| input_text     | String   | Input parameter. The primary text input for the operation. |
| match_text     | String   | Input parameter. The text to compare against. |
| operator       | Dropdown | Input parameter. The operator used to compare texts. Options include `equals`, `not equals`, `contains`, `starts with`, `ends with`, and `regex`. The default is `equals`. |
| case_sensitive | Boolean  | Input parameter. When set to true, the comparison is case sensitive. The default is false. This setting doesn't apply to regex comparisons. |
| message        | Message  | Input parameter. The message to pass through either route. |
| max_iterations | Integer  | Input parameter. The maximum number of iterations allowed for the conditional router. The default is 10. |
| default_route  | Dropdown | Input parameter. The route to take when max iterations are reached. Options include `true_result` or `false_result`. The default is `false_result`. |
| true_result  | Message | Output parameter. The output produced when the condition is true. |
| false_result | Message | Output parameter. The output produced when the condition is false. |

## Loop

The **Loop** component iterates over a list of input by passing individual items to other components attached at the **Item** output port until there are no items left to process. Then, the **Loop** component passes the aggregated result of all looping to the component connected to the **Done** port.

The **Loop** component is like a miniature flow within your flow.
Here's a breakdown of the looping process:

1. Accepts a list of [`Data`](/data-types#data) or [`DataFrame`](/data-types#dataframe) objects, such as a CSV file, through the **Loop** component's **Inputs** port.

2. Splits the input into individual items. For example, a CSV file is broken down by rows.

    Specifically, the **Loop** component repeatedly extracts items by `text` key in the `Data` or `DataFrame` objects until there are no more items to extract.
    Each `item` output is a `Data` objects.

3. Iterates over each `item` by passing them to the **Item** output port.

    This port connects to one or more components that perform actions on each item.
    The final component in the **Item** loop connects back to the **Loop** component's **Looping** port to process the next item.

    Only one component connects to the **Item** port, but you can pass the data through as many components as you need, as long as the last component in the chain connects back to the **Looping** port.

4. After processing all items, the results are aggregated into a single `Data` object that is passed from the **Loop** component's **Done** port to the next component in the flow.

In terms of simplified code, the **Loop** component works like this:

```python
for i in input:             # Receive input data as a list
    process_item(i)         # Process each item through components connected at the Item port
    if has_more_items():
        continue            # Loop back to Looping port to process the next item
    else:
        break               # Exit the loop when no more items are left

done = aggregate_results()  # Compile all returned items

print(done)                 # Send the aggregated results from the Done port to another component
```

<details>
<summary>Loop example</summary>

In the follow example, the **Loop** component iterates over a CSV file until there are no rows left to process.
In this case, the **Item** port passes each row to a **Type Convert** component to convert the row into a `Message` object, passes the `Message` to a **Structured Output** component to be processed into structured data that is then passed back to the **Loop** component's **Looping** port.
After processing all rows, the **Loop** component loads the aggregated list of structured data into a Chroma DB database through the **Chroma DB** component connected to the **Done** port.

## Notify and Listen

The **Notify** and **Listen** components are used together.

The **Notify** component builds a notification from the current flow's context, including specific data content and a status identifier.

The resulting notification is sent to the **Listen** component.
The notification data can then be passed to other components in the flow, such as the **If-Else** component.

## Run flow

The **Run Flow** component runs another Langflow flow as a subprocess of the current flow.

You can use this component to chain flows together, run flows conditionally, and attach flows to [**Agent** component](/components-agents) as [tools for the agent](/agents-tools) to run as needed.

When used with an agent, the `name` and `description` metadata that the agent uses to register the tool are created automatically.

When you select a flow for the **Run Flow** component, it uses the target flow's graph structure to dynamically generate input and output fields on the **Run Flow** component.

### Run Flow parameters

Some **Run Flow** component input parameters are hidden by default in the visual editor.
You can toggle parameters through the <Icon name="SlidersHorizontal" aria-hidden="true"/> **Controls** in each [component's header menu](/concepts-components#component-menus).

| Name              | Type     | Description                                                    |
|-------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| flow_name_selected| Dropdown | Input parameter. The name of the flow to run.                  |
| session_id        | String   | Input parameter. The session ID for the flow run, if you want to pass a custom session ID for the subflow. |
| flow_tweak_data   | Dict     | Input parameter. Dictionary of tweaks to customize the flow's behavior. Available tweaks depend on the selected flow. |
| dynamic inputs    | Various  | Input parameters. Additional inputs are generated based on the selected flow. |
| run_outputs  | A `List` of types (`Data`, `Message`, or `DataFrame`)  | Output parameter. All outputs are generated from running the flow.  |

## Legacy logic components

The following logic components are legacy components.
You can still use them in your flows, but they are no longer supported and can be removed in a future release.

Replace these components with suggested alternatives as soon as possible.
Components marked deprecated in addition to legacy should be replaced immediately.

<details>
<summary>Condition/Data Conditional Router</summary>

As an alternative to this legacy component, see the [**If-Else** component](#if-else).

The **Condition** component routes `Data` objects based on a condition applied to a specified key, including Boolean validation.
It supports `true_output` and `false_output` for routing the results based on the condition evaluation.

This component is useful in workflows that require conditional routing of complex data structures, enabling dynamic decision-making based on data content.

It can process either a single `Data` object or a list of `Data` objects.
The following actions occur when processing a list of `Data` objects:

- Each object in the list is evaluated individually.
- Objects meeting the condition go to `true_output`.
- Objects not meeting the condition go to `false_output`.
- If all objects go to one output, the other output is empty.

The **Condition** component accepts the following parameters:

| Name          | Type     | Description                                 |
|---------------|----------|---------------------------------------------|
| data_input    | Data     | Input parameter. The Data object or list of Data objects to process. This input can handle both single items and lists. |
| key_name      | String   | Input parameter. The name of the key in the Data object to check.     |
| operator      | Dropdown | Input parameter. The operator to apply. Options: `equals`, `not equals`, `contains`, `starts with`, `ends with`, `boolean validator`. Default: `equals`. |
| compare_value | String   | Input parameter. The value to compare against. Not shown/used when operator is `boolean validator`. |

The `operator` options have the following behaviors:

- `equals`: Exact match comparison between the key's value and compare_value.
- `not equals`: Inverse of exact match.
- `contains`: Checks if compare_value is found within the key's value.
- `starts with`: Checks if the key's value begins with compare_value.
- `ends with`: Checks if the key's value ends with compare_value.
- `boolean validator`: Treats the key's value as a Boolean. The following values are considered true:
  - Boolean `true`.
  - Strings: `true`, `1`, `yes`, `y`, `on` (case-insensitive)
  - Any other value is converted using Python's `bool()` function

<details>
<summary>Pass</summary>

As an alternative to this legacy component, use the [**If-Else** component](#if-else) to pass a message without modification.

The **Pass** component forwards the input message without modification.

It accepts the following parameters:

| Name | Display Name | Info |
|------|--------------|------|
| input_message | Input Message | Input parameter. The message to forward. |
| ignored_message | Ignored Message | Input parameter. A second message that is ignored. Used as a workaround for continuity. |
| output_message | Output Message | Output parameter. The forwarded message from the input. |
