<Icon name="Blocks" aria-hidden="true" /> [**Bundles**](/components-bundle-components) contain custom components that support specific third-party integrations with Langflow.

This page describes the components that are available in the **Baidu** bundle.

## Qianfan

The **Qianfan** component generates text using Qianfan's language models.

It can output either a **Model Response** ([`Message`](/data-types#message)) or a **Language Model** ([`LanguageModel`](/data-types#languagemodel)).

Use the **Language Model** output when you want to use a Qianfan model as the LLM for another LLM-driven component, such as an **Agent** or **Smart Function** component.

For more information, see [Language model components](/components-models) and the [Qianfan documentation](https://github.com/baidubce/bce-qianfan-sdk).
