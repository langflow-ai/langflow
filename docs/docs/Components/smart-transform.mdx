This component has been renamed multiple times.
Its previous names include **Lambda Filter** and **Smart Function**.

The **Smart Transform** component uses an LLM to generate a Lambda function to filter or transform structured data based on natural language instructions.
You must connect this component to a [language model component](/components-models), which is used to generate a function based on the natural language instructions you provide in the **Instructions** parameter.
The LLM runs the function against the data input, and then outputs the results as [`Data`](/data-types#data).

:::tip
Provide brief, clear instructions, focusing on the desired outcome or specific actions, such as `Filter the data to only include items where the 'status' is 'active'`.
One sentence or less is preferred because end punctuation, like periods, can cause errors or unexpected behavior.

If you need to provide more details instructions that aren't directly relevant to the Lambda function, you can input them in the **Language Model** component's **Input** field or through a **Prompt Template** component.
:::

The following example uses the **API Request** endpoint to pass JSON data from the `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users` endpoint to the **Smart Transform** component.
Then, the **Smart Transform** component passes the data and the instruction `extract emails` to the attached **Language Model** component.
From there, the LLM generates a filter function that extracts email addresses from the JSON data, returning the filtered data as chat output.

## Smart Transform parameters

<PartialParams />

| Name | Display Name | Info |
|------|--------------|------|
| data | Data | Input parameter. The structured data to filter or transform using a Lambda function. |
| llm | Language Model | Input parameter. Connect [`LanguageModel`](/data-types#languagemodel) output from a **Language Model** component. |
| filter_instruction | Instructions | Input parameter. The natural language instructions for how to filter or transform the data. The LLM uses these instructions to create a Lambda function. |
| sample_size | Sample Size | Input parameter. For large datasets, the number of characters to sample from the dataset head and tail. Only applied if the dataset meets or exceeds `max_size`. Default: `1000`. |
| max_size | Max Size | Input parameter. The number of characters for the dataset to be considered large, which triggers sampling by the `sample_size` value. Default: `30000`. |
