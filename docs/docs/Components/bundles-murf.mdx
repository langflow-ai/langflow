<Icon name="Blocks" aria-hidden="true" /> [**Bundles**](/components-bundle-components) contain custom components that support specific third-party integrations with Langflow.

This page describes the components that are available in the **Murf** bundle.

## Set up Murf AI

To use Murf components in Langflow, you first need an API key.

### Generate an API Key

Go to the [Murf API Dashboard](https://murf.ai/api/dashboard?utm_source=langflow-docs) and sign up for an account.

For more information about Murf API authentication and usage, see the [Murf API documentation](https://murf.ai/api/docs/introduction/overview).

#### Advanced Audio Customization
For more control over the audio output:
1. Enable advanced parameters
2. Adjust the speed (rate) and pitch sliders
3. Select a different audio format (e.g., WAV for higher quality)
4. Choose between Mono or Stereo channel configuration
5. Set the appropriate sample rate for your use case

### Troubleshooting

- **API Key Issues**: Ensure your API key is valid and has sufficient credits
- **Voice Loading**: If voices don't load, check your internet connection and API key validity
- **Audio Generation**: For large texts, consider breaking them into smaller chunks
- **Format Compatibility**: Ensure your target system supports the chosen audio format
