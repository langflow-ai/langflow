# Data components in Langflow

Data components load data from a source into your flow.

They may perform some processing or type checking, like converting raw HTML data into text, or ensuring your loaded file is of an acceptable type.

## Use data components in a flow

Components like [News search](#news-search), [RSS reader](#rss-reader), and [Web search](#web-search) all fetch data into Langflow, and connect to Langflow in the same way. They can output the retrieved data in [DataFrame](/data-types#dataframe) format, or can be connected to an **Agent** component to be used as tools.

For example, to connect all three components to an Agent component, do the following:

1. Create the [Simple Agent starter flow](/simple-agent).
2. In the **Agent** component, in the **OpenAI API Key** field, add your OpenAI API key.
3. Add the **News search**, **RSS reader**, and **Web Search** components to your flow.
4. In all three components, enable **Tool Mode**.
5. Connect the three components to the **Agent** component's **Tools** port.
The flow looks like the following:

![Data components connected to agent](/img/connect-data-components-to-agent.png)

6. Open the **Playground** and enter `Use the websearch component to get me an RSS feed of the latest news.`
The Agent uses the `perform_search` tool to return a list of RSS feeds.
7. Enter the name of an RSS feed that interests you.
The Agent uses the `read_rss` tool to fetch and summarize the latest RSS feed.

## API Request

This component makes HTTP requests using URLs or cURL commands.

1. To use this component in a flow, connect the **Data** output to a component that accepts the input.
For example, connect the **API Request** component to a **Chat Output** component.

2. In the API component's **URLs** field, enter the endpoint for your request.
This example uses `https://dummy-json.mock.beeceptor.com/posts`, which is a list of technology blog posts.

3. In the **Method** field, enter the type of request.
This example uses GET to retrieve a list of blog posts.
The component also supports POST, PATCH, PUT, and DELETE.

4. Optionally, enable the **Use cURL** button to create a field for pasting curl requests.
The equivalent call in this example is `curl -v https://dummy-json.mock.beeceptor.com/posts`.

5. Click **Playground**, and then click **Run Flow**.
Your request returns a list of blog posts in the `result` field.

## SQL database

This component executes SQL queries on [SQLAlchemy-compatible databases](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/).
It supports any SQLAlchemy-compatible database, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and others.

To use this component in a flow, do the following:

1. Create a test database called `test.db`.
```shell
sqlite3 test.db
```

2. Add values to the test database.
```shell
sqlite3 test.db "CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, email TEXT, age INTEGER); INSERT INTO users (name, email, age) VALUES ('John Doe', 'john@example.com', 30), ('Jane Smith', 'jane@example.com', 25), ('Bob Johnson', 'bob@example.com', 35);"
```

3. Verify that `test.db` has been created and contains your data.
```shell
sqlite3 test.db "SELECT * FROM users;"
```

Result:
```shell
1|John Doe|john@example.com
2|Jane Smith|jane@example.com
3|John Doe|john@example.com
4|Jane Smith|jane@example.com
```

4. In the **SQL Database** component's **Database URL** field, add the connection string for `test.db`, such as `sqlite:///test.db`.

With this connection established, the **SQL Query** field now accepts SQL queries.
Instead of manually entering SQL queries, connect this database to an agent as a **Tool** to query it with natural language.

5. In the **SQL Database** component, enable **Tool Mode**, and then connect it to an **Agent** component.
The flow looks like the following:

![SQL database connected to agent](/img/component-sql-database.png)

6. In the **Agent** component, in the **OpenAI API Key** field, add your OpenAI API key.
7. Open the **Playground** and ask `What users are in my database?`
The Agent uses the `run_sql_query` tool to retrieve the information, and additionally identifies the duplicate `users` entries.

Result:
```text
Here are the users in your database:

1. **John Doe** - Email: john@example.com
2. **Jane Smith** - Email: jane@example.com
3. **John Doe** - Email: john@example.com
4. **Jane Smith** - Email: jane@example.com

It seems there are duplicate entries for the users.

## URL

This component fetches content from one or more URLs, processes the content, and returns it in various formats. It supports output in plain text or raw HTML.

In the component's **URLs** field, enter the URL you want to load. To add multiple URL fields, click <Icon name="Plus" aria-hidden="true"/> **Add URL**.

1. To use this component in a flow, connect the **DataFrame** output to a component that accepts the input.
For example, connect the **URL** component to a **Chat Output** component.

2. In the URL component's **URLs** field, enter the URL for your request.
This example uses `langflow.org`.

3. Optionally, in the **Max Depth** field, enter how many pages away from the initial URL you want to crawl.
Select `1` to crawl only the page specified in the **URLs** field.
Select `2` to crawl all pages linked from that page.
The component crawls by link traversal, not by URL path depth.

4. Click **Playground**, and then click **Run Flow**.
The text contents of the URL are returned to the Playground as a structured DataFrame.

5. In the **URL** component, change the output port to **Message**, and then run the flow again.
The text contents of the URL are returned as unstructured raw text, which you can extract patterns with the [Parser](/components-processing#parser) component.

<details>
<summary>Parameters</summary>

**Inputs**

| Name | Display Name | Info |
|------|--------------|------|
| urls | URLs | Click the '+' button to enter one or more URLs to crawl recursively. |
| max_depth | Max Depth | Controls how many 'clicks' away from the initial page the crawler will go. |

| format | Output Format | Output Format. Use `Text` to extract the text from the HTML or `HTML` for the raw HTML content. |
| timeout | Timeout | Timeout for the request in seconds. |
| headers | Headers | The headers to send with the request. |

**Outputs**

| Name | Display Name | Info |
|------|--------------|------|
| data | Data | A list of [Data](/data-types#data) objects containing fetched content and metadata. |
| text | Message | The fetched content as formatted text. |
| dataframe | DataFrame | The content formatted as a [DataFrame](/data-types#dataframe) object. |

</details>

## Webhook

This component defines a webhook trigger that runs a flow when it receives an HTTP POST request.

If the input is not valid JSON, the component wraps it in a `payload` object so that it can be processed and still trigger the flow.

When a **Webhook** component is added to the workspace, a new **Webhook cURL** tab becomes available in the **API** pane that contains an HTTP POST request for triggering the webhook component. For example:
Replace `LANGFLOW_SERVER_ADDRESS`, `FLOW_ID`, and `LANGFLOW_API_KEY` with the values from your Langflow deployment.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  "http://LANGFLOW_SERVER_ADDRESS/api/v1/webhook/FLOW_ID" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-api-key: LANGFLOW_API_KEY' \
  -d '{"any": "data"}'
```

The **Webhook** component is often paired with a [**Parser** component](/components-processing#parser) to extract relevant data from the raw payload.
For more information, see [Trigger flows with webhooks](/webhook).

To troubleshoot a flow with a **Webhook** component and verify that the component is receiving data, you can create a small flow that outputs only the parsed payload:

1. Create a flow with **Webhook**, **Parser**, and **Chat Output** components.
2. Connect the Webhook component's **Data** output to the Parser component's **Data** input.
3. Connect the Parser component's **Parsed Text** output to the Chat Output component's **Text** input.
4. Edit the **Parser** component to set **Mode** to **Stringify**.

    This mode passes the data received by the Webhook component as a string that is printed by the **Chat Output** component.

5. Click **Share**, select **API access**, and then copy the **Webhook cURL** code snippet.
6. Optional: Edit the `data` in the code snippet if you want to pass a different payload.
7. Send the POST request to trigger the flow.
8. Click **Playground** to verify that the **Chat Output** component printed the JSON data from your POST request.

For more information, see [Trigger flows with webhooks](/webhook).
<details>
<summary>Parameters</summary>

**Inputs**

| Name | Display Name | Description |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| data | Payload | Receives a payload from external systems through HTTP POST requests. |
| curl | cURL | The cURL command template for making requests to this webhook. |
| endpoint | Endpoint | The endpoint URL where this webhook receives requests. |

**Outputs**

| Name | Display Name | Description |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| output_data | Data | Outputs processed data from the webhook input, and returns an empty [Data](/data-types#data) object if no input is provided. If the input is not valid JSON, the component wraps it in a `payload` object. |
