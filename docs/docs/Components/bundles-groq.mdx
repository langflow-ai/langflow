<Icon name="Blocks" aria-hidden="true" /> [**Bundles**](/components-bundle-components) contain custom components that support specific third-party integrations with Langflow.

This page describes the components that are available in the **Groq** bundle.

For more information, see the [Groq documentation](https://groq.com/).

## Groq text generation

This component generates text using Groq's language models.

It can output either a **Model Response** ([`Message`](/data-types#message)) or a **Language Model** ([`LanguageModel`](/data-types#languagemodel)).
Specifically, the **Language Model** output is an instance of [`ChatGroq`](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/chat/groq) configured according to the component's parameters.

Use the **Language Model** output when you want to use a Groq model as the LLM for another LLM-driven component, such as an **Agent** or **Smart Function** component.

For more information, see [Language model components](/components-models).
