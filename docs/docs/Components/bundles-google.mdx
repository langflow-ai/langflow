[Bundles](/components-bundle-components) contain custom components that support specific third-party integrations with Langflow.

This page describes the components that are available in the **Google** bundle.

## BigQuery

See [**BigQuery** component](/integrations-google-big-query).

## Google Generative AI

This component generates text using [Google Generative AI models](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/).

### Google Generative AI parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Google API Key | SecretString | Input parameter. Your Google API key to use for the Google Generative AI. This key is required for authentication with Google's generative AI services and should be kept secure. |
| Model | String | Input parameter. The name of the model to use, such as `"gemini-pro"`. Choose from available Google Generative AI models based on your specific use case and performance requirements. |
| Max Output Tokens | Integer | Input parameter. The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response. This parameter helps control the length of the generated text and manage API costs. |
| Temperature | Float | Input parameter. Run inference with this temperature. Controls the randomness of the output, where lower values produce more focused responses and higher values create more creative outputs. |
| Top K | Integer | Input parameter. Consider the set of top K most probable tokens. This parameter limits the model's choices to the K most likely next tokens, helping to focus the generation process. |
| Top P | Float | Input parameter. The maximum cumulative probability of tokens to consider when sampling. This nucleus sampling technique helps maintain quality while allowing for controlled randomness in text generation. |
| N | Integer | Input parameter. Number of chat completions to generate for each prompt. Useful for generating multiple variations of responses or for comparison purposes. |
| model | LanguageModel | Output parameter. An instance of ChatGoogleGenerativeAI configured with the specified parameters. This object can be connected to other components in your flow for text generation tasks. |

## Google Generative AI Embeddings

The **Google Generative AI Embeddings** component connects to Google's generative AI embedding service using the GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings class from the `langchain-google-genai` package.

For more information about using embedding model components in flows, see [**Embedding Model** components](/components-embedding-models).

### Google Generative AI Embeddings parameters

| Name | Display Name | Info |
|------|--------------|------|
| api_key | API Key | Input parameter. The secret API key for accessing Google's generative AI service. Required. |
| model_name | Model Name | Input parameter. The name of the embedding model to use. Default: "models/text-embedding-004". |
| embeddings | Embeddings | Output parameter. The built GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings object. |

## Google Search API

This component allows you to call the Google Search API.

### Google Search API parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| google_api_key | SecretString | Input parameter. A Google API key for authentication. This key is required to access Google's Custom Search API and should be obtained from the Google Cloud Console. |
| google_cse_id | SecretString | Input parameter. A Google Custom Search Engine ID. This ID identifies your specific search engine configuration and determines which websites and content sources will be searched. |
| input_value | String | Input parameter. The search query input. This is the text that will be used to search the web using Google's search algorithms. |
| k | Integer | Input parameter. The number of search results to return. Controls how many search results are included in the output, allowing you to balance between comprehensive results and processing efficiency. |
| results | List[Data] | Output parameter. A list of search results. Contains the retrieved web pages, titles, snippets, and URLs from the Google search, formatted as Data objects for use in your flow. |
| tool | Tool | Output parameter. A Google Search tool for use in LangChain. This tool can be integrated with LangChain agents and other components that require web search capabilities. |

## Serper Google Search API

This component allows you to call the Serper.dev Google Search API.

### Google Serper API parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| serper_api_key | SecretString | Input parameter. An API key for Serper.dev authentication. This key is required to access the Serper.dev Google Search API service and should be obtained from your Serper.dev account dashboard. |
| input_value | String | Input parameter. The search query input. This is the text that will be used to search the web using Serper.dev's Google search integration. |
| k | Integer | Input parameter. The number of search results to return. Controls how many search results are included in the output, allowing you to balance between comprehensive results and processing efficiency. |
| results | List[Data] | Output parameter. A list of search results. Contains the retrieved web pages, titles, snippets, and URLs from the Google search via Serper.dev, formatted as Data objects for use in your flow. |
| tool | Tool | Output parameter. A Serper Google Search tool for use in LangChain. This tool can be integrated with LangChain agents and other components that require web search capabilities through the Serper.dev service. |

## Google Vertex AI

For information about Vertex AI components, see the [**Vertex AI** bundle](/bundles-vertexai).

## Legacy Google components

The following Google components are considered legacy components.
You can still use them in your flows, but they are no longer supported and can be removed in future releases.

As an alternative to these components, you can use [Composio components](/integrations-composio) to connect your flows to Google services.

<details>
<summary>Google OAuth Token</summary>

The **Google OAuth Token** component was deprecated in Langflow 1.4.0.

To connect your flows to Google OAuth services, use [Composio components](/integrations-composio).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Gmail Loader</summary>

This component loads emails from Gmail using [Service Account JSON](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/service-account) credentials and label ID filters.

As an alternative, you can use [Composio components](/integrations-composio) to connect your flows to Google services.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Google Drive Loader</summary>

This component loads documents from Google Drive using [Service Account JSON](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/service-account) credentials and document ID filters.

While there is no direct replacement, consider using the [**API Request** component](/components-data#api-request) to call the Google Drive API.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Google Drive Search</summary>

This component searches Google Drive using [Service Account JSON](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/service-account) credentials and various query strings and filters.

While there is no direct replacement, consider using the [**API Request** component](/components-data#api-request) to call the Google Drive API.
