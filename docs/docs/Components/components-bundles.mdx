Bundles contain custom components that support specific third-party integrations with Langflow.
You add them to your flows and configure them in the same way as Langflow's core components.

To browse bundles, click <Icon name="Blocks" aria-hidden="true" /> **Bundles** in the visual editor.

## Bundle maintenance and documentation

Many bundled components are developed by third-party contributors to the Langflow codebase.

Some providers contribute documentation with their bundles, whereas others document their bundles in their own documentation.
Some bundles have no documentation.

To find documentation for a specific bundled component, browse the Langflow docs and your provider's documentation.
If available, you can also find links to relevant documentation, such as API endpoints, through the component itself:

1. Click the component to expose the [component's header menu](/concepts-components#component-menus).
2. Click <Icon name="Ellipsis" aria-hidden="true" /> **More**.
3. Select **Docs**.

The Langflow documentation focuses on using bundles within flows.
For that reason, it focuses on the Langflow-specific configuration steps for bundled components.
For information about provider-specific features or APIs, see the provider's documentation.

## Component parameters

## Core components and bundles

:::tip
The Langflow documentation doesn't list all bundles or components in bundles.
For the most accurate and up-to-date list of bundles and components for your version of Langflow, check <Icon name="Blocks" aria-hidden="true" /> **Bundles** in the visual editor.

If you can't find a component that you used in an earlier version of Langflow, it may have been removed or marked as a [legacy component](#legacy-bundles).
:::

Langflow offers generic <Icon name="Component" aria-hidden="true" /> **Core components** in addition to third-party, provider-specific bundles.

If you are looking for a specific service or integration, you can <Icon name="Search" aria-hidden="true" /> **Search** components in the visual editor.

If all else fails, you can always create your own [custom components](/components-custom-components).

## Legacy bundles

import PartialLegacy from '@site/docs/_partial-legacy.mdx';

<PartialLegacy />

The following bundles include only legacy components.

### Embeddings bundle

* **Embedding Similarity**: Replaced by built-in similarity search functionality in vector store components.
* **Text Embedder**: Replaced by the embedding model components.

### Vector Stores bundle

This bundle contains only the legacy **Local DB** component.
All other vector store components can be found within their respective provider-specific bundles, such as the [**DataStax** bundle](/bundles-datastax).

<details>
<summary>Local DB</summary>

Replace the **Local DB** component with the **Chroma DB** vector store component (in the **Chroma** bundle) or another vector store component.

The **Local DB** component reads and writes to a persistent, in-memory Chroma DB instance intended for use with Langflow.
It has separate modes for reads and writes, automatic collection management, and default persistence in your Langflow cache directory.

![A basic flow with a Local DB component in Retrieve mode.](/img/component-local-db.png)

Set the **Mode** parameter to reflect the operation you want the component to perform, and then configure the other parameters accordingly.
Some parameters are only available for one mode.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="ingest" label="Ingest">

To create or write to your local Chroma vector store, use **Ingest** mode.

The following parameters are available in **Ingest** mode:

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Name Your Collection** (`collection_name`) | String | Input parameter. The name for your Chroma vector store collection. Default: `langflow`. Only available in **Ingest** mode. |
| **Persist Directory** (`persist_directory`) | String | Input parameter. The base directory where you want to create and persist the vector store. If you use the **Local DB** component in multiple flows or to create multiple collections, collections are stored at `$PERSISTENT_DIRECTORY/vector_stores/$COLLECTION_NAME`. If not specified, the default location is your Langflow cache directory (`LANGFLOW_CONFIG_DIR`). For more information, see [Memory management options](/memory). |
| **Embedding** (`embedding`) | Embeddings | Input parameter. The embedding function to use for the vector store. |
| **Allow Duplicates** (`allow_duplicates`) | Boolean | Input parameter. If true (default), writes don't check for existing duplicates in the collection, allowing you to store multiple copies of the same content. If false, writes won't add documents that match existing documents already present in the collection. If false, it can strictly enforce deduplication by searching the entire collection or only search the number of records, specified in `limit`. Only available in **Ingest** mode. |
| **Ingest Data** (`ingest_data`) | Data or DataFrame | Input parameter. The records to write to the collection. Records are embedded and indexed for semantic search. Only available in **Ingest** mode. |
| **Limit** (`limit`) | Integer | Input parameter. Limit the number of records to compare when **Allow Duplicates** is false. This can help improve performance when writing to large collections, but it can result in some duplicate records. Only available in **Ingest** mode. |

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="retrieve" label="Retrieve">

To read from your local Chroma vector store, use **Retrieve** mode.

The following parameters are available in **Retrieve** mode:

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Persist Directory** (`persist_directory`) | String | Input parameter. The base directory where you want to create and persist the vector store. If you use the **Local DB** component in multiple flows or to create multiple collections, collections are stored at `$PERSISTENT_DIRECTORY/vector_stores/$COLLECTION_NAME`. If not specified, the default location is your Langflow cache directory (`LANGFLOW_CONFIG_DIR`). For more information, see [Memory management options](/memory). |
| **Existing Collections** (`existing_collections`) | String | Input parameter. Select a previously-created collection to search. Only available in **Retrieve** mode. |
| **Embedding** (`embedding`) | Embeddings | Input parameter. The embedding function to use for the vector store. |
| **Search Type** (`search_type`) | String | Input parameter. The type of search to perform, either `Similarity` or `MMR`. Only available in **Retrieve** mode. |
| **Search Query** (`search_query`) | String | Input parameter. Enter a query for similarity search. Only available in **Retrieve** mode. |
| **Number of Results** (`number_of_results`) | Integer | Input parameter. Number of search results to return. Default: 10. Only available in **Retrieve** mode. |

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

</details>

### Zep bundle

<details>
<summary>Zep Chat Memory</summary>

The **Zep Chat Memory** component is a legacy component.
Replace this component with the [**Message History** component](/components-helpers#message-history).

This component creates a `ZepChatMessageHistory` instance, enabling storage and retrieval of chat messages using Zep, a memory server for LLMs.

It accepts the following parameters:

| Name          | Type          | Description                                               |
|---------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| url           | MessageText   | Input parameter. The URL of the Zep instance. Required. |
| api_key       | SecretString  | Input parameter. The API Key for authentication with the Zep instance. |
| api_base_path | Dropdown      | Input parameter. The API version to use. Options include api/v1 or api/v2. |
| session_id    | MessageText   | Input parameter. The unique identifier for the chat session. Optional. |
| message_history | BaseChatMessageHistory  | Output parameter. An instance of ZepChatMessageHistory for the session. |

</details>
