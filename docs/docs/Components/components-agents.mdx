Langflow's **Agent** and **MCP Tools** components are critical for building agent flows.
These components define the behavior and capabilities of AI agents in your flows.

<PartialAgentsWork />

## Examples of agent flows

For examples of flows using the **Agent** and **MCP Tools** components, see the following:

* [Langflow quickstart](/get-started-quickstart): Start with the **Simple Agent** template, modify its tools, and then learn how to use an agent flow in an application.

    The **Simple Agent** template creates a basic agent flow with an **Agent** component that can use two other Langflow components as tools.
    The LLM specified in the **Agent** component's settings can use its own built-in functionality as well as the functionality provided by the connected tools when generating responses.

* [Use an agent as a tool](/agents-tools#use-an-agent-as-a-tool): Create a multi-agent flow.

* [Use Langflow as an MCP client](/mcp-client) and [Use Langflow as an MCP server](/mcp-server): Use the **Agent** and **MCP Tools** components to implement the Model Context Protocol (MCP) in your flows.

## Agent component {#agent-component}

The **Agent** component is the primary agent actor in your agent flows.
This component uses an LLM integration to respond to input, such as a chat message or file upload.

The agent can use the tools already available in the base LLM as well as additional tools that you connect to the **Agent** component's **Tools** port.
You can connect any Langflow component as a tool, including other **Agent** components and MCP servers through the [**MCP Tools** component](#mcp-connection).

For more information about using this component, see [Use Langflow agents](/agents).

## MCP Tools component {#mcp-connection}

The **MCP Tools** component connects to a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server and exposes the MCP server's functions as tools for Langflow agents to use to respond to input.

In addition to publicly available MCP servers and your own custom-built MCP servers, you can connect Langflow MCP servers, which allow your agent to use your Langflow flows as tools.
To do this, use the **MCP Tools** component's [SSE mode](/mcp-client#mcp-sse-mode) to connect to your Langflow project's MCP server at the `/api/v1/mcp/sse` endpoint.

For more information, see [Use Langflow as an MCP client](/mcp-client) and [Use Langflow as an MCP server](/mcp-server).

<details>
<summary>Earlier versions of the MCP Tools component</summary>

* In Langflow version 1.5, the **MCP Connection** component was renamed to the **MCP Tools** component.
* In Langflow version 1.3, the **MCP Tools (stdio)** and **MCP Tools (SSE)** components were removed and replaced by the unified **MCP Connection** component, which was later renamed to **MCP Tools**.
