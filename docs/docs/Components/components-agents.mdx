Langflow's **Agent** and **MCP Tools** components are critical for building agentic flows.
These components define the behavior and capabilities of AI agents in your flows.

<details>
<summary>How agents work</summary>

Agents extend Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating _tools_, which are functions that provide additional context and enable autonomous task execution.
These integrations make agents more specialized and powerful than standalone LLMs.

Whereas an LLM might generate acceptable, inert responses to general queries and tasks, an agent can leverage the integrated context and tools to provide more relevant responses and even take action.
For example, you might create an agent that can access your company's knowledge base, repositories, and other resources to help your team with tasks that require knowledge of your specific products, customers, and code.

Agents use LLMs as a reasoning engine to process input, determine which actions to take to address the query, and then generate a response.
The response could be a typical text-based LLM response, or it could involve an action, like editing a file, running a script, or calling an external API.

In an agentic context, tools are functions that the agent can run to perform tasks or access external resources.
A function is wrapped as a `Tool` object with a common interface the agent understands.
Agents become aware of tools through tool registration where the agent is provided a list of available tools typically at agent initialization.
The `Tool` object's description tells the agent what the tool can do so that it can decide whether the tool is appropriate for a given request.

## Examples of agentic flows

For examples of agentic flows using the **Agent** and **MCP Tools** components, see the following:

* [**Simple Agent** template](/simple-agent): Create a basic agentic flow in Langflow with an **Agent** component that can use two other Langflow components as tools.
The LLM specified in the **Agent** component's settings can use its own built-in functionality as well as the functionality provided by the connected tools when generating responses.

* [Langflow quickstart](/get-started-quickstart): Modify the **Simple Agent** template to use different tools, and then learn how to use an agentic flow in an application.

* [Use an agent as a tool](/agents-tools#use-an-agent-as-a-tool): Create a multi-agent flow.

* [Use Langflow as an MCP client](/mcp-client) and [Use Langflow as an MCP server](/mcp-server): Use the **Agent** and **MCP Tools** components to implement the Model Context Protocol (MCP) in your flows.

## Agent component {#agent-component}

The **Agent** component is the primary agent actor in your agentic flows.
This component uses an LLM integration to respond to input, such as a chat message or file upload.

The agent can use the tools already available in the base LLM model as well as additional tools that you connect to the **Agent** component's **Tools** port.
You can connect any Langflow component as a tool, including other **Agent** components and MCP servers through the [**MCP Tools** component](#mcp-connection).

For more information about using this component, see [Use Langflow agents](/agents).

## MCP Tools component {#mcp-connection}

The **MCP Tools** component connects to a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server and exposes the MCP server's functions as tools for Langflow agents to use to respond to input.

You can connect to publicly available MCP servers and your own custom-built MCP servers, and Langflow MCP servers, which allows your agent to use your Langflow flows as tools.
To do this, use the **MCP Tools** component's [SSE mode](/mcp-client#mcp-sse-mode) to connect to your Langflow MCP server at the `/api/v1/mcp/sse` endpoint.

For more information about using this component and serving flows as MCP tools, see [Use Langflow as an MCP client](/mcp-client) and [Use Langflow as an MCP server](/mcp-server).

<details>
<summary>Earlier versions of the MCP Tools component</summary>

* In Langflow version 1.5, the **MCP Connection** component was renamed to the **MCP Tools** component.
* In Langflow version 1.3, the **MCP Tools (stdio)** and **MCP Tools (SSE)** components were deprecated and replaced by the unified **MCP Connection** component, which was later renamed to **MCP Tools**.

## Legacy agent components

The following components are legacy components.
You can still use these components in your flows, but they are no longer maintained and they can be removed in future releases.

Replace these components with the **Agent** component or other Langflow components, depending on your use case.

* **CrewAI Sequential Task**
