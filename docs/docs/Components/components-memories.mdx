# Memory components in Langflow

Components in the **Memories** category are moved to [Bundles](/components-bundle-components) as of Langflow 1.5.

**Bundles** are third-party components grouped by provider.

For more information on bundled components, see the component provider's documentation.

## Use a memory component in a flow

Memory components store and retrieve chat messages by `session_id`.

They are distinct from vector store components, because they are built specifically for storing and retrieving chat messages from external databases.

Memory components provide access to their respective external databases **as memory**. This allows Large Language Models (LLMs) or [agents](/components-agents) to access external memory for persistence and context retention.

This example flow stores and retrieves chat history with an **Redis Chat Memory** component connected to **Store Message** and **Message history** components.

The **Store Message** helper component stores chat memories as [Data](/concepts-objects) objects, and the **Message History** helper component retrieves chat messages as [Data](/concepts-objects) objects or strings.
