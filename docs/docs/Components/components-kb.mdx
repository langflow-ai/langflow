Langflow knowledge bases are local repositories of vector embeddings created from your data that agents can reference to answer domain-specific questions.

Knowledge bases are distinct from [**Vector Store** components](/components-vector-stores) because they are exclusively co-located with your flows.
This allows each knowledge base to be re-used in new flows without requiring re-ingestion of the data in every flow.

Knowledge bases use the **Knowledge Ingestion** and **Knowledge Retrieval** components.

For more information about these components and Langflow knowledge bases in flows, see [Use knowledge bases](/knowledge).
