In Langflow version 1.5, the **Tools** category was deprecated.

All components that were in this category were replaced by other components or moved to other component categories.

:::important
Many components that were in the **Tools** category are legacy components.
You can use these components in your flows, but they are no longer maintained and may be removed in a future release.

It is recommended that you replace all legacy components with the replacement components described on this page.
:::

## Calculator Tool

The **Calculator Tool** component is a legacy component.
Replace this component with the [**Calculator** component](/components-helpers#calculator) in the **Helpers** category.

## MCP Connection

This component was moved to the **Agents** category and renamed to the [**MCP Tools** component](/components-agents#mcp-connection)

## Python tools

The **Python REPL** and **Python Code Structured** components are legacy components.
Replace these components with the [**Python Interpreter** component](/components-processing#python-interpreter) in the **Processing** category.

## Search and API request tools

Many tool components performed basic API calls to public archives or search APIs.
All such components in the **Tools** category are legacy components.

You have two options for replacing these components:

* [**Data components**](/components-data): Use Langflow's core components for search and API calls, such as the [**Web Search** component](/components-data#web-search) and [**News Search** component](/components-data#news-search).

* <Icon name="Blocks" aria-hidden="true" /> [**Bundles**](/components-bundle-components): Use provider-specific search and API components:

    * [**arXiv** bundle](/bundles-arxiv)
    * [**Bing** bundle](/bundles-bing)
    * [**DataStax** bundle](/bundles-datastax)
    * [**DuckDuckGo** bundle](/bundles-duckduckgo)
    * [**Exa** bundle](/bundles-exa)
    * [**Glean** bundle](/bundles-glean)
    * [**Google** bundle](/bundles-google)
    * [**Icosa Computing** bundle](/bundles-icosacomputing)
    * [**LangChain** bundle](/bundles-langchain)
    * [**SearchApi** bundle](/bundles-searchapi)
    * **SerpApi** bundle
    * **Tavily** bundle
    * [**Wikipedia** bundle](/bundles-wikipedia)
    * **Yahoo! Search** bundle

    There is no direct replacement for the **SearXNG Search Tool** component.
    Use another provider's search component, create a custom component, or use a core component like the [**API Request** component](/components-data#api-request).
