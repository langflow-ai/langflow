In Langflow version 1.5, the **Tools** category was deprecated.

All components that were in this category were replaced by other components or moved to other categories in the **Components** menu.

:::important
Many components that were in the **Tools** category are legacy components.
You can use these components in your flows, but they are no longer maintained and may be removed in a future release.

It is recommended that you replace all legacy components with the replacement components described on this page.
:::

## Calculator Tool component

The **Calculator Tool** component is a legacy component.
Replace this component with the [**Calculator** component](/components-helpers#calculator) in the **Helpers** category.

## MCP Connection component

This component was moved to the **Agents** category and renamed to the [**MCP Tools** component](/components-agents#mcp-connection)

## Python tools

The **Python REPL** and **Python Code Structured** components are legacy components.
Replace these components with the [**Python Interpreter** component](/components-processing#python-interpreter) in the **Processing** category.

## Search and API request tools

Many tool components performed basic API calls to public archives or search APIs.
All such components in the **Tools** category are legacy components.

You have two options for replacing these components:

* Use the generic [data components](/components-data) for search and API calls, such as the [**Web Search**](/components-data#web-search) and [**News Search**](/components-data#news-search) components.

* Use the provider-specific search and API components in the **Bundles** category:
    * [arXiv bundle](/bundles-arxiv)
    * [Bing bundle](/bundles-bing)
    * [DataStax bundle](/bundles-datastax)
    * [DuckDuckGo bundle](/bundles-duckduckgo)
    * [Exa bundle](/bundles-exa)
    * [Glean bundle](/bundles-glean)
    * [Google bundle](/bundles-google)
    * [Icosa Computing bundle](/bundles-icosacomputing)
    * [LangChain bundle](/bundles-langchain)
    * [SearchApi bundle](/bundles-searchapi)
    * SerpApi bundle
    * Tavily bundle
    * [Wikipedia bundle](/bundles-wikipedia)
