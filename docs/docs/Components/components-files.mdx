## Directory

The **Directory** component recursively loads files from a directory, with options for file types, depth, and concurrency.

Files must be of a [supported type and size](#file-type-and-size-limits) to be loaded.

Outputs either a [`Data`](/data-types#data) or [`DataFrame`](/data-types#dataframe) object, depending on the directory contents.

### Directory parameters

<PartialParams />

## Read File {#file}

In Langflow version 1.7.0, this component was renamed from **File** to **Read File**.

The **Read File** component loads and parses files, converts the content into a `Data`, `DataFrame`, or `Message` object.
It supports multiple file types, provides parameters for parallel processing and error handling, and supports advanced parsing with the Docling library.

You can add files to the **Read File** component in the visual editor or at runtime, and you can upload multiple files at once.
For more information about uploading files and working with files in flows, see [File management](/concepts-file-management) and [Create a chatbot that can ingest files](/chat-with-files).

### File type and size limits

By default, the maximum file size is 1024 MB.
To modify this value, change the `LANGFLOW_MAX_FILE_SIZE_UPLOAD` [environment variable](/environment-variables).

<details>
<summary>Supported file types</summary>

The following file types are supported by the **Read File** component.
Use archive and compressed formats to bundle multiple files together, or use the [**Directory** component](#directory) to load all files in a directory.

- `.bz2`
- `.csv`
- `.docx`
- `.gz`
- `.htm`
- `.html`
- `.json`
- `.js`
- `.md`
- `.mdx`
- `.pdf`
- `.py`
- `.sh`
- `.sql`
- `.tar`
- `.tgz`
- `.ts`
- `.tsx`
- `.txt`
- `.xml`
- `.yaml`
- `.yml`
- `.zip`

</details>

If you need to load an unsupported file type, you must use a different component that supports that file type and, potentially, parses it outside Langflow, or you must convert it to a supported type before uploading it.

### File parameters

<PartialParams />

| Name | Display Name | Info |
|------|--------------|------|
| path | Files | Input parameter. The path to files to load. Can be local or in [Langflow file management](/concepts-file-management). Supports individual files and bundled archives. |
| file_path | Server File Path | Input parameter. A `Data` object with a `file_path` property pointing to a file in [Langflow file management](/concepts-file-management) or a `Message` object with a path to the file. Supersedes **Files** (`path`) but supports the same file types. |
| separator | Separator | Input parameter. The separator to use between multiple outputs in `Message` format. |
| silent_errors | Silent Errors | Input parameter. If `true`, errors in the component don't raise an exception. Default: Disabled (`false`). |
| delete_server_file_after_processing | Delete Server File After Processing | Input parameter. If `true` (default), the **Server File Path** (`file_path`) is deleted after processing. |
| ignore_unsupported_extensions | Ignore Unsupported Extensions | Input parameter. If enabled (`true`), files with unsupported extensions are accepted but not processed. If disabled (`false`), the **Read File** component either can throw an error if an unsupported file type is provided. The default is `true`. |
| ignore_unspecified_files | Ignore Unspecified Files | Input parameter. If `true`, `Data` with no `file_path` property is ignored. If `false` (default), the component errors when a file isn't specified. |
| concurrency_multithreading | Processing Concurrency | Input parameter. The number of files to process concurrently if multiple files are uploaded. Default is 1. Values greater than 1 enable parallel processing for 2 or more files. Ignored for single-file uploads and advanced parsing. |
| advanced_parser | Advanced Parser | Input parameter. If `true`, enables [advanced parsing](#advanced-parsing). Only available for single-file uploads of compatible file types. Default: Disabled (`false`). |

### Advanced parsing

Starting in Langflow version 1.6, the **Read File** component supports advanced document parsing using the [Docling](https://docling-project.github.io/docling/) library for supported file types.

To use advanced parsing, do the following:

1. Complete the following prerequisites, if applicable:

    * **Install Langflow version 1.6 or later**: Earlier versions don't support advanced parsing with the **Read File** component. For upgrade guidance, see the [Release notes](/release-notes).

    * **Install Docling dependency on macOS Intel (x86_64)**: The Docling dependency isn't installed by default for macOS Intel (x86_64). Use the [Docling installation guide](https://docling-project.github.io/docling/installation/) to install the Docling dependency.

        For all other operating systems, the Docling dependency is installed by default.

    * **Enable Developer Mode for Windows**:
    <PartialDevModeWindows />

        Developer Mode isn't required for Langflow OSS on Windows.

2. Add one valid file to the **Read File** component.

    :::info Advanced parsing limitations
    * Advanced parsing processes only one file.
    If you select multiple files, the **Read File** component processes the first file only, ignoring any additional files.
    To process multiple files with advanced parsing, pass each file to a separate **Read File** components, or use the dedicated [**Docling** components](/bundles-docling).

    * Advanced parsing can process any of the **Read File** component's supported file types except `.csv`, `.xlsx`, and `.parquet` files because it is designed for document processing, such as extracting text from PDFs.
    For structured data analysis, use the [**Parser** component](/components-processing#parser).
    :::

3. Enable **Advanced Parsing**.

4. Click <Icon name="SlidersHorizontal" aria-hidden="true"/> **Controls** in the [component's header menu](/concepts-components#component-menus) to configure advanced parsing parameters, which are hidden by default:

    | Name | Display Name | Info |
    |------|--------------|------|
    | pipeline | Pipeline | Input parameter, advanced parsing. The Docling pipeline to use, either `standard` (default, recommended) or `vlm` (may produce inconsistent results). |
    | ocr_engine | OCR Engine | Input parameter, advanced parsing. The OCR parser to use if `pipeline` is `standard`. Options are `None` (default) or [`EasyOCR`](https://pypi.org/project/easyocr/). `None` means that no OCR engine is used, and this can produce inconsistent or broken results for some documents. This setting has no effect with the `vlm` pipeline. |
    | md_image_placeholder | Markdown Image Placeholder | Input parameter, advanced parsing. Defines the placeholder for image files if the output type is **Markdown**. Default: `<!-- image -->`. |
    | md_page_break_placeholder | Markdown Page Break Placeholder | Input parameter, advanced parsing. Defines the placeholder for page breaks if the output type is **Markdown**. Default: `""` (empty string). |
    | doc_key | Document Key | Input parameter, advanced parsing. The key to use for the `DoclingDocument` column, which holds the structured information extracted from the source document. See [Docling Document](https://docling-project.github.io/docling/concepts/docling_document/) for details. Default: `doc`. |

    :::tip
    For additional Docling features, including other components and OCR parsers, use the [**Docling** bundle](/bundles-docling).
    :::

### File output

The output of the **Read File** component depends on the number of files loaded and whether advanced parsing is enabled.
If multiple options are available, you can set the output type near the component's output port.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="zero" label="No files">

If you run the **Read File** component with no file selected, it throws an error, or, if **Silent Errors** is enabled, produces no output.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="one-false" label="One file without advanced parsing">

If advanced parsing is disabled and you upload one file, the following output types are available:

- **Structured Content**: Available only for `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.parquet`, and `.json` files.

    - For `.csv` files, produces a [`DataFrame`](/data-types#dataframe) representing the table data.
    - For `.json` files, produces a [`Data`](/data-types#data) object with the parsed JSON data.

- **Raw Content**: A [`Message`](/data-types#message) containing the file's raw text content.

- **File Path**: A [`Message`](/data-types#message) containing the path to the file in [Langflow file management](/concepts-file-management).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="one-true" label="One file with advanced parsing">

If advanced parsing is enabled and you upload one file, the following output types are available:

- **Structured Output**: A [`DataFrame`](/data-types#dataframe) containing the Docling-processed document data with text elements, page numbers, and metadata.

- **Markdown**: A [`Message`](/data-types#message) containing the uploaded document contents in Markdown format with image placeholders.

- **File Path**: A [`Message`](/data-types#message) containing the path to the file in [Langflow file management](/concepts-file-management).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="multi" label="Multiple files">

If you upload multiple files, the component outputs **Files**, which is a [`DataFrame`](/data-types#dataframe) containing the content and metadata of all selected files.

[Advanced parsing](#advanced-parsing) doesn't support multiple files; it processes only the first file.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Write File {#save-file}

In Langflow version 1.7.0, this component was renamed from **Save File** to **Write File**.

The **Write File** component creates a file containing data produced by another component.
Several file formats are supported, and you can store files in [Langflow storage](/memory), AWS S3, Google Drive, or the local file system.

To configure the **Write File** component and use it in a flow, do the following:

1. Connect [`DataFrame`](/data-types#dataframe), [`Data`](/data-types#data), or [`Message`](/data-types#message) output from another component to the **Write File** component's **Input** port.

    You can connect the same output to multiple **Write File** components if you want to create multiple files, save the data in different file formats, or save files to multiple locations.

2. In **File Name**, enter a file name and an optional path.

    The **File Name** parameter controls where the file is saved.
    It can contain a file name or an entire file path:

    * **Default location**: If you only provide a file name, then the file is stored in the Langflow data directory. For example,`~/Library/Caches/langflow/data` on macOS.

    * **Subdirectory**: To store files in subdirectories, add the path to the **File Name** parameter.
    If a given subdirectory doesn't already exist, Langflow automatically creates it.
    For example, `files/my_file` creates `my_file` in `/data/files`, and it creates the `files` subdirectory if it doesn't already exist.

    * **Absolute or relative path**: To store files elsewhere in your environment or local file storage, provide the absolute or relative path to the desired location.
    For example, `~/Desktop/my_file` saves `my_file` to the desktop.

    Don't include an extension in the file name.
    If you do, the extension is treated as part of the file name; it has no impact on the **File Format** parameter.

3. In the [component's header menu](/concepts-components#component-menus), click <Icon name="SlidersHorizontal" aria-hidden="true"/> **Controls**, select the desired file format, and then click **Close**.

    The available **File Format** options depend on the input data type:

    * `DataFrame` can be saved to CSV (default), Excel (requires `openpyxl` [custom dependency](/install-custom-dependencies)), JSON (fallback default), or Markdown.

    * `Data` can be saved to CSV, Excel (requires `openpyxl` [custom dependency](/install-custom-dependencies)), JSON (default), or Markdown.

    * `Message` can be saved to TXT, JSON (default), or Markdown.

    :::warning Overwrites allowed
    If you have multiple **Write File** components, in one or more flows, with the same file name, path, and extension, the file contains the data from the most recent run only.
    Langflow doesn't block overwrites if a matching file already exists.
    To avoid unintended overwrites, use unique file names and paths.
    :::

4. To test the **Write File** component, click <Icon name="Play" aria-hidden="true" /> **Run component**, and then click <Icon name="TextSearch" aria-hidden="true" /> **Inspect output** to get the filepath where the file was saved.

    The component's literal output is a `Message` containing the original data type, the file name and extension, and the absolute filepath to the file based on the **File Name** parameter.
    For example:

    ```text
    DataFrame saved successfully as 'my_file.csv' at /Users/user.name/Library/Caches/langflow/data/my_file.csv
    ```

    If the **File Name** contains a subdirectory or other non-default path, this is reflected in the `Message` output.
    For example, a CSV file with the file name `~/Desktop/my_file` could produce the following output:

    ```text
    DataFrame saved successfully as '/Users/user.name/Desktop/my_file.csv' at /Users/user.name/Desktop/my_file.csv
    ```

5. Optional: If you want to use the saved file in a flow, you must use an API call or another component to retrieve the file from the given filepath.
