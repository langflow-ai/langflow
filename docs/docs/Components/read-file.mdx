In Langflow version 1.7.0, this component was renamed from **File** to **Read File**.

The **Read File** component loads and parses files, converts the content into a `Data`, `DataFrame`, or `Message` object.
It supports multiple file types, provides parameters for parallel processing and error handling, and supports advanced parsing with the Docling library.

You can add files to the **Read File** component in the visual editor or at runtime, and you can upload multiple files at once.
For more information about uploading files and working with files in flows, see [File management](/concepts-file-management) and [Create a chatbot that can ingest files](/chat-with-files).

## File type and size limits

By default, the maximum file size is 1024 MB.
To modify this value, change the `LANGFLOW_MAX_FILE_SIZE_UPLOAD` [environment variable](/environment-variables).

<details>
<summary>Supported file types</summary>

The following file types are supported by the **Read File** component.
Use archive and compressed formats to bundle multiple files together, or use the [**Directory** component](/directory) to load all files in a directory.

- `.bz2`
- `.csv`
- `.docx`
- `.gz`
- `.htm`
- `.html`
- `.json`
- `.js`
- `.md`
- `.mdx`
- `.pdf`
- `.py`
- `.sh`
- `.sql`
- `.tar`
- `.tgz`
- `.ts`
- `.tsx`
- `.txt`
- `.xml`
- `.yaml`
- `.yml`
- `.zip`

</details>

If you need to load an unsupported file type, you must use a different component that supports that file type and, potentially, parses it outside Langflow, or you must convert it to a supported type before uploading it.

## File parameters

<PartialParams />

| Name | Display Name | Info |
|------|--------------|------|
| path | Files | Input parameter. The path to files to load. Can be local or in [Langflow file management](/concepts-file-management). Supports individual files and bundled archives. |
| file_path | Server File Path | Input parameter. A `Data` object with a `file_path` property pointing to a file in [Langflow file management](/concepts-file-management) or a `Message` object with a path to the file. Supersedes **Files** (`path`) but supports the same file types. |
| separator | Separator | Input parameter. The separator to use between multiple outputs in `Message` format. |
| silent_errors | Silent Errors | Input parameter. If `true`, errors in the component don't raise an exception. Default: Disabled (`false`). |
| delete_server_file_after_processing | Delete Server File After Processing | Input parameter. If `true` (default), the **Server File Path** (`file_path`) is deleted after processing. |
| ignore_unsupported_extensions | Ignore Unsupported Extensions | Input parameter. If enabled (`true`), files with unsupported extensions are accepted but not processed. If disabled (`false`), the **Read File** component either can throw an error if an unsupported file type is provided. The default is `true`. |
| ignore_unspecified_files | Ignore Unspecified Files | Input parameter. If `true`, `Data` with no `file_path` property is ignored. If `false` (default), the component errors when a file isn't specified. |
| concurrency_multithreading | Processing Concurrency | Input parameter. The number of files to process concurrently if multiple files are uploaded. Default is 1. Values greater than 1 enable parallel processing for 2 or more files. Ignored for single-file uploads and advanced parsing. |
| advanced_parser | Advanced Parser | Input parameter. If `true`, enables [advanced parsing](#advanced-parsing). Only available for single-file uploads of compatible file types. Default: Disabled (`false`). |

## Advanced parsing

Starting in Langflow version 1.6, the **Read File** component supports advanced document parsing using the [Docling](https://docling-project.github.io/docling/) library for supported file types.

To use advanced parsing, do the following:

1. Complete the following prerequisites, if applicable:

    * **Install Langflow version 1.6 or later**: Earlier versions don't support advanced parsing with the **Read File** component. For upgrade guidance, see the [Release notes](/release-notes).

    * **Install Docling dependency on macOS Intel (x86_64)**: The Docling dependency isn't installed by default for macOS Intel (x86_64). Use the [Docling installation guide](https://docling-project.github.io/docling/installation/) to install the Docling dependency.

        For all other operating systems, the Docling dependency is installed by default.

    <PartialDockerDoclingDeps />

    * **Enable Developer Mode for Windows**:
    <PartialDevModeWindows />

        Developer Mode isn't required for Langflow OSS on Windows.

2. Add one valid file to the **Read File** component.

    :::info Advanced parsing limitations
    * Advanced parsing processes only one file.
    If you select multiple files, the **Read File** component processes the first file only, ignoring any additional files.
    To process multiple files with advanced parsing, pass each file to a separate **Read File** components, or use the dedicated [**Docling** components](/bundles-docling).

    * Advanced parsing can process any of the **Read File** component's supported file types except `.csv`, `.xlsx`, and `.parquet` files because it is designed for document processing, such as extracting text from PDFs.
    For structured data analysis, use the [**Parser** component](/parser).
    :::

3. Enable **Advanced Parsing**.

4. Click <Icon name="SlidersHorizontal" aria-hidden="true"/> **Controls** in the [component's header menu](/concepts-components#component-menus) to configure advanced parsing parameters, which are hidden by default:

    | Name | Display Name | Info |
    |------|--------------|------|
    | pipeline | Pipeline | Input parameter, advanced parsing. The Docling pipeline to use, either `standard` (default, recommended) or `vlm` (may produce inconsistent results). |
    | ocr_engine | OCR Engine | Input parameter, advanced parsing. The OCR parser to use if `pipeline` is `standard`. Options are `None` (default) or [`EasyOCR`](https://pypi.org/project/easyocr/). `None` means that no OCR engine is used, and this can produce inconsistent or broken results for some documents. This setting has no effect with the `vlm` pipeline. |
    | md_image_placeholder | Markdown Image Placeholder | Input parameter, advanced parsing. Defines the placeholder for image files if the output type is **Markdown**. Default: `<!-- image -->`. |
    | md_page_break_placeholder | Markdown Page Break Placeholder | Input parameter, advanced parsing. Defines the placeholder for page breaks if the output type is **Markdown**. Default: `""` (empty string). |
    | doc_key | Document Key | Input parameter, advanced parsing. The key to use for the `DoclingDocument` column, which holds the structured information extracted from the source document. See [Docling Document](https://docling-project.github.io/docling/concepts/docling_document/) for details. Default: `doc`. |

    :::tip
    For additional Docling features, including other components and OCR parsers, use the [**Docling** bundle](/bundles-docling).

## File output

The output of the **Read File** component depends on the number of files loaded and whether advanced parsing is enabled.
If multiple options are available, you can set the output type near the component's output port.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="zero" label="No files">

If you run the **Read File** component with no file selected, it throws an error, or, if **Silent Errors** is enabled, produces no output.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="one-false" label="One file without advanced parsing">

If advanced parsing is disabled and you upload one file, the following output types are available:

- **Structured Content**: Available only for `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.parquet`, and `.json` files.

    - For `.csv` files, produces a [`DataFrame`](/data-types#dataframe) representing the table data.
    - For `.json` files, produces a [`Data`](/data-types#data) object with the parsed JSON data.

- **Raw Content**: A [`Message`](/data-types#message) containing the file's raw text content.

- **File Path**: A [`Message`](/data-types#message) containing the path to the file in [Langflow file management](/concepts-file-management).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="one-true" label="One file with advanced parsing">

If advanced parsing is enabled and you upload one file, the following output types are available:

- **Structured Output**: A [`DataFrame`](/data-types#dataframe) containing the Docling-processed document data with text elements, page numbers, and metadata.

- **Markdown**: A [`Message`](/data-types#message) containing the uploaded document contents in Markdown format with image placeholders.

- **File Path**: A [`Message`](/data-types#message) containing the path to the file in [Langflow file management](/concepts-file-management).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="multi" label="Multiple files">

If you upload multiple files, the component outputs **Files**, which is a [`DataFrame`](/data-types#dataframe) containing the content and metadata of all selected files.

[Advanced parsing](#advanced-parsing) doesn't support multiple files; it processes only the first file.
