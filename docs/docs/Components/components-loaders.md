# Loader components in Langflow

:::info
As of Langflow 1.1, loader components are now found in the **Components** menu under **Bundles**.
:::

Loaders fetch data into Langflow from various sources, such as databases, websites, and local files.

## Use a loader component in a flow

This flow creates a question-and-answer chatbot for documents that are loaded into the flow.
The [Unstructured.io](https://unstructured.io/) loader component loads files from your local machine, and then parses them into a list of structured [Data](/guides-data-message) objects. This loaded data informs the **Open AI** component's responses to your questions.
