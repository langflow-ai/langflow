import Icon from "@site/src/components/icon";

Langflow's **Vector Store** components are used to read and write vector data, including embedding storage, vector search, Graph RAG traversals, and specialized provider-specific search, such as OpenSearch, Elasticsearch, and Vectara.

These components are critical for vector search applications, such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbots that need to retrieve relevant context from large datasets.

Most of these components connect to a specific vector database provider, but some components support multiple providers or platforms.
For example, the **Cassandra** vector store component can connect to self-managed Apache Cassandra-based clusters as well as Astra DB, which is a managed Cassandra DBaaS.

Other types of storage, like traditional structured databases and chat memory, are handled through other components like the [**SQL Database** component](/components-data#sql-database) or the [**Message History** component](/components-helpers#message-history).

## Use Vector Store components in a flow

:::tip
For a tutorial using **Vector Store** components in a flow, see [Create a vector RAG chatbot](/chat-with-rag).
:::

The following steps introduce the use of **Vector Store** components in a flow, including configuration details, how the components work when you run a flow, why you might need multiple **Vector Store** components in one flow, and useful supporting components, such as **Embedding Model** and **Parser** components.

1. Create a flow with the **Vector Store RAG** template.

    This template has two subflows.
    The **Load Data** subflow loads embeddings and content into a vector database, and the **Retriever** subflow runs a vector search to retrieve relevant context based on a user's query.

2. Configure the database connection for both [**Astra DB** components](#astra-db), or replace them with another pair of **Vector Store** components of your choice.

    Make sure the components connect to the same vector store, and that the component in the **Retriever** subflow is able to run a similarity search.
    For information about specific configuration parameters, see the section of this page for your chosen **Vector Store** component and [Hidden parameters](#hidden-parameters).

3. To configure the embedding model, do one of the following:

    * **Use an OpenAI model**: In both **OpenAI Embeddings** components, enter your OpenAI API key.
    You can use the default model or select a different OpenAI embedding model.

    * **Use another provider**: Replace the **OpenAI Embeddings** components with another pair of [**Embedding Model** component](/components-embedding-models) of your choice, and then configure the parameters and credentials accordingly.

    * **Use Astra DB vectorize**: If you are using an Astra DB vector store that has a vectorize integration, you can remove both **OpenAI Embeddings** components.
    If you do this, the vectorize integration automatically generates embeddings from the **Ingest Data** (in the **Load Data** subflow) and **Search Query** (in the **Retriever** subflow).

    :::tip
    If your vector store already contains embeddings, make sure your **Embedding Model** components use the same model as your previous embeddings.
    Mixing embedding models in the same vector store can produce inaccurate search results.
    :::

4. Recommended: In the [**Split Text** component](/components-processing#split-text), optimize the chunking settings for your embedding model.
For example, if your embedding model has a token limit of 512, then the **Chunk Size** parameter must not exceed that limit.

    Additionally, because the **Retriever** flow passes the chat input directly to the **Vector Store** component for vector search, make sure that your chat input string doesn't exceed your embedding model's limits.
    For this example, you can enter a query that is within the limits; however, in a production environment, you might need to implement additional checks or preprocessing steps to ensure compliance.
    For example, use additional components to prepare the chat input before running the vector search, or enforce chat input limits in your application code.

5. In the **Language Model** component, enter your OpenAI API key, or select a different provider and model to use for the chat portion of the flow.

6. Run the **Load Data** subflow to populate your vector store.
In the **File** component, select one or more files, and then click <Icon name="Play" aria-hidden="True" /> **Run component** on the **Vector Store** component in the **Load Data** subflow.

    The **Load Data** subflow loads files from your local machine, chunks them, generates embeddings for the chunks, and then stores the chunks and their embeddings in the vector database.

    ![Embedding data into a vector store](/img/vector-store-document-ingestion.png)

    The **Load Data** subflow is separate from the **Retriever** subflow because you probably won't run it every time you use the chat.
    You can run the **Load Data** subflow as needed to preload or update the data in your vector store.
    Then, your chat interactions only use the components that are necessary for chat.

    If your vector store already contains data that you want to use for vector search, then you don't need to run the **Load Data** subflow.

7. Open the **Playground** and start chatting to run the **Retriever** subflow.

    The **Retriever** subflow generates an embedding from chat input, runs a vector search to retrieve similar content from your vector store, parses the search results into supplemental context for the LLM, and then uses the LLM to generate a natural language response to your query.
    The LLM uses the vector search results along with its internal training data and tools, such as basic web search and datetime information, to produce the response.

    ![Retrieval from a vector store](/img/vector-store-retrieval.png)

    To avoid passing the entire block of raw search results to the LLM, the **Parser** component extracts `text` strings from the search results `Data` object, and then passes them to the **Prompt Template** component in `Message` format.
    From there, the strings and other template content are compiled into natural language instructions for the LLM.

    You can use other components for this transformation, such as the **Data Operations** component, depending on how you want to use the search results.

    To view the raw search results, click <Icon name="TextSearch" aria-hidden="True" /> **Inspect output** on the **Vector Store** component after running the **Retriever** subflow.

### Hidden parameters

You can inspect a **Vector Store** component's parameters to learn more about the inputs it accepts, the features it supports, and how to configure it.

Many input parameters for **Vector Store** components are hidden by default in the visual editor.
You can toggle parameters through the <Icon name="SlidersHorizontal" aria-hidden="true"/> **Controls** in each [component's header menu](/concepts-components#component-menus).

Some parameters are conditional, and they are only available after you set other parameters or select specific options for other parameters.
Conditional parameters may not be visible on the **Controls** pane until you set the required dependencies.
However, all parameters are always listed in a [component's code](/concepts-components#component-code).

For information about a specific component's parameters, see the provider's documentation and the component details.

### Search results

If you use a **Vector Store** component to query your vector store, it produces search results that you can pass to downstream components in your flow as a list of [`Data`](/data-types#data) objects or a tabular [`DataFrame`](/data-types#dataframe).
You can set the format near the component's output port in the visual editor.

The exception to this pattern is the **Vectara RAG** component, which outputs only an `answer` string in [`Message`](/data-types#message) format.

### Vector store instances

Because Langflow is based on LangChain, **Vector Store** components use an instance of [LangChain vector store](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/) to drive the underlying vector search functions.
In the component code, this is often instantiated as `vector_store`, but some components use a different name, such as the provider name.

For the **Cassandra Graph** and **Astra DB Graph** components, `vector_store` is an instance of [LangChain graph vector store](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/graph_vectorstores.html).

These instances are provider-specific and configured according to the component's parameters.
For example, the **Redis** component creates an instance of [`RedisVectorStore`](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/redis/) based on the component's parameters, such as the connection string, index name, and schema.

Some LangChain classes don't expose all possible options as component parameters.
Depending on the provider, these options might use default values or allow modification through environment variables, if they are supported in Langflow.
For information about specific options, see the LangChain API reference and provider documentation.

<details>
<summary>Vector Store Connection ports</summary>

The **Astra DB** and **OpenSearch** components have an additional **Vector Store Connection** output.
This output can only connect to a `VectorStore` input port, and it was intended for use with dedicated Graph RAG components.

The only non-legacy component that supports this input is the **Graph RAG** component, which was meant as a Graph RAG extension to the **Astra DB** component.
Instead, you can use the **Astra DB Graph** component that includes both the vector store connection and Graph RAG functionality.
OpenSearch instances support Graph traversal through built-in RAG functionality and plugins.

</details>

## Apache Cassandra

The **Cassandra** and **Cassandra Graph** components can be used with Cassandra clusters, including Astra DB.

### Chroma DB

The **Chroma DB** component creates an ephemeral, Chroma vector database with search capabilities that you can use for experimentation and vector storage.
For more information, see the [Chroma documentation](https://docs.trychroma.com/).

<details>
<summary>Chroma DB sample flow</summary>

1. To use this component in a flow, connect it to a component that outputs `Data` or `DataFrame`.

    This example splits text from a [**URL** component](/components-data#url), and then computes embeddings with the connected **OpenAI Embeddings** component. Chroma DB computes embeddings by default, but you can connect your own embeddings model, as seen in this example.

    ![ChromaDB receiving split text](/img/component-chroma-db.png)

2. In the **Chroma DB** component, in the **Collection** field, enter a name for your embeddings collection.
3. Optional: To persist the Chroma database, in the **Persist** field, enter a directory to store the `chroma.sqlite3` file.
This example uses `./chroma-db` to create a directory relative to where Langflow is running.
4. To load data and embeddings into your Chroma database, in the **Chroma DB** component, click <Icon name="Play" aria-hidden="true"/> **Run component**.

    :::tip
    When loading duplicate documents, enable the **Allow Duplicates** option in Chroma DB if you want to store multiple copies of the same content, or disable it to automatically deduplicate your data.
    :::

5. To view the split data, in the **Split Text** component, click <Icon name="TextSearch" aria-hidden="true"/> **Inspect Output**.
6. To query your loaded data, open the **Playground** and query your database.
Your input is converted to vector data and compared to the stored vectors in a vector similarity search.

#### Generate embeddings

The **Astra DB** component offers two methods for generating embeddings.

* ***Embedding Model**: Use your own embedding model by connecting an [**Embedding Model** component](/components-embedding-models) in Langflow.

* **Astra Vectorize**: Use Astra DB's built-in embedding generation service. When creating a new collection, choose the embeddings provider and models, including NVIDIA's `NV-Embed-QA` model hosted by DataStax.
For more information, see the [Astra DB Serverless documentation](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-db-serverless/databases/embedding-generation.html).

    :::important
    With vectorize, the embedding model you choose when you create a collection cannot be changed later.
    :::

For an example of using the **Astra DB** component with an embedding model, see the **Vector Store RAG** template.

#### Hybrid search

The **Astra DB** component includes Astra DB's [hybrid search](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-db-serverless/databases/hybrid-search.html) feature through the Astra DB Data API.

Hybrid search performs a vector similarity search and a lexical search, compares the results of both searches, and then returns the most relevant results overall.

To use hybrid search through the **Astra DB** component, you must [create a collection with that supports hybrid search](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-db-serverless/api-reference/collection-methods/create-collection.html#example-hybrid).

The following **Astra DB** component parameters are used for hybrid search:

* **Search Query**: The query to use for vector search.
* **Lexical Terms**: A comma-separated string of keywords, like `features, data, attributes, characteristics`.
* **Reranker**: The re-ranker model to use for hybrid search, such as `nvidia/llama-3.2-nv.reranker`.

<details>
<summary>Hybrid search example</summary>

To use hybrid search through the **Astra DB** component, do the following:

1. Create a flow based on the **Hybrid Search RAG** template, which includes an **Astra DB** component that is pre-configured for hybrid search.
2. In the **Language Model** components, add your OpenAI API key.
3. Delete the **Language Model** component that is connected to the **Structured Output** component's **Input Message** port, and then connect the **Chat Input** component to that port.
4. Configure the **Astra DB** vector store component:

    1. Enter your Astra DB application token.
    2. In the **Database** field, select your database.
    3. In the **Collection** field, select or create a collection with hybrid search capabilities enabled.

5. Connect the first **Parser** component's **Parsed Text** output to the **Astra DB** component's **Lexical Terms** input.

6. Click the **Structured Output** component to expose the [component's header menu](/concepts-components#component-menus), click <Icon name="SlidersHorizontal" aria-hidden="true"/> **Controls**, find the **Format Instructions** row, click <Icon name="Expand" aria-hidden="true"/> **Expand**, and then replace the prompt with the following text:

    ```text
    You are a database query planner that takes a user's requests, and then converts to a search against the subject matter in question.
    You should convert the query into:
    1. A list of keywords to use against a Lucene text analyzer index, no more than 4. Strictly unigrams.
    2. A question to use as the basis for a QA embedding engine.
    Avoid common keywords associated with the user's subject matter.
    ```

7. Click **Finish Editing**, and then click **Close** to save your changes to the component.

8. Open the **Playground**, and then enter a natural language question that you would ask about your database.

    In this example, your input is sent to both the **Astra DB** and **Structured Output** components:

    * The input sent directly to the **Astra DB** component's **Search Query** port is used as a string for similarity search.
    An embedding is generated from the query string using the collection's Astra DB vectorize integration.

    * The input sent to the **Structured Output** component is processed by the **Structured Output**, **Language Model**, and **Parser** components to extract comma-separated `keywords` used for the lexical search portion of the hybrid search.

    The complete hybrid search query is executed against your database using the Data API's `find_and_rerank` command.
    The API's response is output as a `DataFrame` that is transformed into a text string `Message` by another **Parser** component.
    Finally, the **Chat Output** component prints the `Message` response to the **Playground**.

9. Optional: Exit the **Playground**, and then click <Icon name="TextSearch" aria-hidden="true"/> **Inspect Output** on each individual component to understand how lexical keywords were constructed and view the raw response from the Data API.
This is helpful for debugging flows where a certain component isn't receiving input as expected from another component.

    * **Structured Output component**: The output is the `Data` object produced by applying the output schema to the LLM's response to the input message and format instructions.
    The following example is based on the aforementioned instructions for keyword extraction:

        ```
        1. Keywords: features, data, attributes, characteristics
        2. Question: What characteristics can be identified in my data?
        ```

    * **Parser component**: The output is the string of keywords extracted from the structured output `Data`, and then used as lexical terms for the hybrid search.

    * **Astra DB component**: The output is the `DataFrame` containing the results of the hybrid search as returned by the Data API.
