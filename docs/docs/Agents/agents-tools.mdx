Configure tools connected to agents to extend their capabilities.

## Edit a tool's actions

When you set any component to **Tool Mode** or **Tool** output, an agent can use the functions or actions provided by that component.

To edit a tool's actions, in the tool component, click <Icon name="SlidersHorizontal" aria-hidden="true"/> **Edit Tools** to modify the following settings for each action:

* `name`: A human-readable name for the action.
* `description`: A human-readable description of the action's purpose.
* `enabled`: Whether the action is available (true) or not (false).

These fields tell the agent which actions it can use and how to use them, without requiring you to modify the agent's prompt instructions.
If you think an agent is using a tool incorrectly, edit the `description` to help the agent better understand the tool.

For example, the [**URL** component](/components-data#url) has two actions available when in **Tool Mode**:

| Tool Name | Description | Enabled |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `fetch_content` | Fetch content from web pages recursively | true |
| `fetch_content_as_message` | Fetch web content formatted as messages | true |

Tools also have a default tool identifier.
This value can't be changed unless you create a custom component.

## Use an agent as a tool

To create multi-agent flows, you can set another **Agent** component to **Tool Mode**, and then attach that agent as a tool for your primary **Agent** component.

To try this for yourself, add an additional agent to the **Simple Agent** template:

1. Create a flow based on the **Simple Agent** template.
2. Add a second **Agent** component to the flow.
3. Add your **OpenAI API Key** to both **Agent** components.
4. In the second **Agent** component, change the model to `gpt-4.1`, and then enable **Tool Mode**.
5. Click <Icon name="SlidersHorizontal" aria-hidden="true"/> **Edit Tools** to set tool names and descriptions that help the primary agent understand how to use those tools.

    For this example, change the tool name to `Agent-gpt-41` and set the description to `Use the gpt-4.1 model for complex problem solving`.
    This lets the primary agent know that this tool uses the `gpt-4.1` model, which could be helpful for tasks requiring a larger context window, such as large scrape and search tasks.

    As another example, you could attach several specialized models to a primary agent, such as agents that are trained on certain tasks or domains, and then the primary agent would call each specialized agent as needed to respond to queries.

    You can also enable and disable tools if you want to limit the available toolset.

6. Connect the new agent's **Toolset** port to the existing agent's **Tools** port.

## Add custom components as tools {#components-as-tools}

An agent can use [custom components](/components-custom-components) as tools.

1. To add a custom component to an agentic flow, click **New Custom Component** in the **Components** menu.

2. Enter Python code into the **Code** pane to create the custom component.

    If you don't already have code for a custom component, you can use the following code snippet as an example before creating your own.

    <details>
    <summary>Text Analyzer custom component</summary>

    This code creates a text analyzer component.

    ```python
    from langflow.custom import Component
    from langflow.io import MessageTextInput, Output
    from langflow.schema import Data
    import re

    class TextAnalyzerComponent(Component):
        display_name = "Text Analyzer"
        description = "Analyzes and transforms input text."
        documentation: str = "http://docs.langflow.org/components/custom"
        icon = "chart-bar"
        name = "TextAnalyzerComponent"

        inputs = [
            MessageTextInput(
                name="input_text",
                display_name="Input Text",
                info="Enter text to analyze",
                value="Hello, World!",
                tool_mode=True,
            ),
        ]

        outputs = [
            Output(display_name="Analysis Result", name="output", method="analyze_text"),
        ]

        def analyze_text(self) -> Data:
            text = self.input_text

            # Perform text analysis
            word_count = len(text.split())
            char_count = len(text)
            sentence_count = len(re.findall(r'\w+[.!?]', text))

            # Transform text
            reversed_text = text[::-1]
            uppercase_text = text.upper()

            analysis_result = {
                "original_text": text,
                "word_count": word_count,
                "character_count": char_count,
                "sentence_count": sentence_count,
                "reversed_text": reversed_text,
                "uppercase_text": uppercase_text
            }

            data = Data(value=analysis_result)
            self.status = data
            return data
    ```
    </details>

3. Enable **Tool Mode** in the custom component.
4. Connect the custom component's tool output to the **Agent** component's **Tools** input.
5. Open the <Icon name="Play" aria-hidden="true" /> **Playground** and instruct the agent, `Use the text analyzer on this text: "Agents really are thinking machines!"`

    Based on your instruction, the agent should call the `analyze_text` action and return the result.
    For example:

    ```
    gpt-4o
    Finished
    0.6s
    Here is the analysis of the text "Agents really are thinking machines!":
    Original Text: Agents really are thinking machines!
    Word Count: 5
    Character Count: 36
    Sentence Count: 1
    Reversed Text: !senihcam gnikniht era yllaer stnegA
    Uppercase Text: AGENTS REALLY ARE THINKING MACHINES!
    ```

## Make any component a tool

If the component you want to use as a tool doesn't have a **Tool Mode** button, add `tool_mode=True` to one of the component's inputs, and connect the new **Toolset** output to the agent's **Tools** input.

Langflow supports **Tool Mode** for the following data types:

* `DataInput`
* `DataFrameInput`
* `PromptInput`
* `MessageTextInput`
* `MultilineInput`
* `DropdownInput`

For example, the example code in [Use custom components as tools](#components-as-tools) included `tool_mode=True` to the `MessageTextInput` input so the custom component could be used as a tool:

```python
inputs = [
    MessageTextInput(
        name="input_text",
        display_name="Input Text",
        info="Enter text to analyze",
        value="Hello, World!",
        tool_mode=True,
    ),
]
```

## Use flows as tools

An agent can use flows that are saved in your workspace as tools with the [**Run Flow** component](/components-logic#run-flow).

1. Add a **Run Flow** component to your flow.
2. Select the flow you want the agent to use as a tool.
3. Enable **Tool Mode**.
The selected flow becomes an [action](#edit-a-tools-actions) in the **Run Flow** component.
4. Connect the **Run Flow** component's **Tool** output to the **Agent** component's **Tools** input.
5. Open the **Playground**, and then ask the agent, `What tools are you using to answer my questions?`
Your flow should be visible in the response as an available tool.
6. Ask the agent a question that specifically uses the connected flow as a tool.
The connected flow returns an answer based on your question.
