Langflow's [**Agent** component](/components-agents) is critical for building agentic flows.
This component provides everything you need to create an agent, including multiple Large Language Model (LLM) providers, tool calling, and custom instructions.
It simplifies agent configuration so you can focus on application development.

<details>
<summary>How agents work</summary>

Agents extend LLMs by integrating _tools_, which are functions that provide additional context and enable autonomous task execution.
These integrations make agents more specialized and powerful than standalone LLMs.

Whereas an LLM might generate acceptable, inert responses to general queries and tasks, an agent can leverage the integrated context and tools to provide more relevant responses and even take action.
For example, you might create an agent that can access your company's knowledge base, repositories, and other resources to help your team with tasks that require knowledge of your specific products, customers, and code.

Agents use LLMs as a reasoning engine to process input, determine which actions to take to address the query, and then generate a response.
The response could be a typical text-based LLM response, or it could involve an action, like editing a file, running a script, or calling an external API.

In an agentic context, tools are functions that the agent can run to perform tasks or access external resources.
A function is wrapped as a `Tool` object with a common interface that the agent understands.
Agents become aware of tools through tool registration, which is when the agent is provided a list of available tools typically at agent initialization.
The `Tool` object's description tells the agent what the tool can do so that it can decide whether the tool is appropriate for a given request.

## Use the Agent component in a flow

The following steps explain how to create an agentic flow in Langflow from a blank flow.
For a prebuilt example, use the [**Simple Agent** template](/simple-agent) or try the [Langflow quickstart](/get-started-quickstart).

1. Click **New Flow**, and then click **Blank Flow**.
2. Add an **Agent** component to the **Workspace**.
3. Enter a valid OpenAI API key.

    The default model for the **Agent** component is an OpenAI model.
    If you want to use a different provider, edit the **Model Provider**, **Model Name**, and **API Key** fields accordingly.
    For more information, see [Agent component parameters](#agent-component-parameters).

4. Add [**Chat input** and **Chat output** components](/components-io) to your flow, and then connect them to the **Agent** component.

    At this point, you have created a basic LLM-based chat flow that you can test in the <Icon name="Play" aria-hidden="true" /> **Playground**.
    However, this flow only chats with the LLM.
    To enhance this flow and make it truly agentic, add some tools, as explained in the next steps.

5. Add **News Search**, **URL**, and **Calculator** components to your flow.
6. Enable **Tool Mode** in the **News Search**, **URL**, and **Calculator** components:

    1. Click the **News Search** component to expose the [component's header menu](/concepts-components#component-menus), and then enable **Tool Mode**.
    2. Repeat for the **URL** and **Calculator** components.
    3. Connect the **Toolset** port for each tool component to the **Tools** port on the **Agent** component.

    **Tool Mode** makes a component into a tool by modifying the component's inputs.
    With **Tool Mode** enabled, a component can accept requests from an **Agent** component to use the component's available actions as tools.

    When in **Tool Mode**, a component has a **Toolset** port that you must connect to an **Agent** component's **Tools** port if you want to allow the agent to use that component's actions as tools.

    For more information, see [Configure tools for agents](/agents-tools).

8. Open the <Icon name="Play" aria-hidden="true" /> **Playground**, and then ask the agent, `What tools are you using to answer my questions?`

    The agent should respond with a list of the connected tools.
    It may also include built-in tools.

    ```text
    I use a combination of my built-in knowledge (up to June 2024) and a set of external tools to answer your questions. Here are the main types of tools I can use:
    Web Search & Content Fetching: I can fetch and summarize content from web pages, including crawling links recursively.
    News Search: I can search for recent news articles using Google News via RSS feeds.
    Calculator: I can perform arithmetic calculations and evaluate mathematical expressions.
    Date & Time: I can provide the current date and time in various time zones.
    These tools help me provide up-to-date information, perform calculations, and retrieve specific data from the internet when needed. If you have a specific question, let me know, and I'll use the most appropriate tool(s) to help!
    ```

9. To test a specific tool, ask the agent a question that uses one of the tools, such as `Summarize today's tech news`.

    To help you debug and test your flows, the **Playground** displays the agent's tool calls, the provided input, and the raw output the agent received before generating the summary.
    With the given example, the agent should call the **News Search** component's `search_news` action.

You've successfully created a basic agentic flow that uses some generic tools.

To continue building on this tutorial, try connecting other tool components or [use Langflow as an MCP client](/mcp-client) to support more complex and specialized tasks.

For a multi-agent example, see [Use an agent as a tool](/agents-tools#use-an-agent-as-a-tool).

## Agent component parameters

You can configure the **Agent** component to use your preferred provider and model, custom instructions, and tools.

### Provider and model

Use the **Model Provider** (`agent_llm`) and **Model Name** (`llm_model`) settings to select the model provider and LLM that you want the agent to use.

The **Agent** component includes many models from several popular model providers.
To access other providers and models, set **Model Provider** to **Custom**, and then connect a [**Language Model** component](/components-models).

:::

### Model provider API key

In the **API Key** field, enter a valid authentication key for your selected model provider, if you selected one of the built-in providers.
For example, to use the default OpenAI model, you must provide a valid OpenAI API key for an OpenAI account that has credits and permission to call OpenAI LLMs.

You can enter the key directly, but it is recommended that you follow industry best practices for storing and referencing API keys.
For example, you can use a <Icon name="Globe" aria-hidden="true"/> [global variable](/configuration-global-variables) or [environment variables](/environment-variables).
For more information, see [Add component API keys to Langflow](/configuration-api-keys#add-component-api-keys-to-langflow).

If you select **Custom** as the model provider, authentication is handled in the incoming **Language Model** component.

### Agent instructions and input

In the **Agent Instructions** (`system_prompt`) field, you can provide custom instructions that you want the **Agent** component to use for every conversation.

These instructions are applied in addition to the **Input** (`input_value`), which can be entered directly or provided through another component, such as a **Chat Input** component.

### Tools

Agents are most useful when they have the appropriate tools available to complete requests.

An **Agent** component can use any Langflow component as a tool, including other agents and MCP servers.

To attach a component as a tool, you must enable **Tool Mode** on the component that you want to attach, and then attach it to the **Agent** component's **Tools** port.
For more information, see [Configure tools for agents](/agents-tools).

:::tip
To allow agents to use tools from MCP servers, use the [**MCP Tools** component](/components-agents#mcp-connection).
:::

### Additional parameters

Many optional **Agent** component input parameters are hidden by default in the visual editor.
You can view and toggle all parameters through the <Icon name="SlidersHorizontal" aria-hidden="true"/> **Controls** in the [component's header menu](/concepts-components#component-menus).

With the **Agent** component, the available parameters can change depending on the selected provider and model.
For example, some models support additional modes, arguments, or features like chat memory and temperature.

Some additional input parameters include the following:

* **Current Date** (`add_current_date_tool`): When enabled (`true`), this setting adds a tool to the agent that can retrieve the current date.
* **Handle Parse Errors** (`handle_parsing_errors`): When enabled (`true`), this setting allows the agent to fix errors, like typos, when analyzing user input.
* **Verbose** (`verbose`): When enabled (`true`), this setting records detailed logging output for debugging and analysis.

## Agent component output

The **Agent** component outputs a **Response** (`response`) that is [`Message` data](/data-types#message) containing the agent's raw response to the query.

Typically, this is passed to a **Chat Output** component to return the response in a human-readable format.
It can also be passed to other components if you need to process the response further before, or in addition to, returning it to the user.
