Langflow's [**Agent** component](/components-agents) is critical for building agent flows.
This component provides everything you need to create an agent, including multiple Large Language Model (LLM) providers, tool calling, and custom instructions.
It simplifies agent configuration so you can focus on application development.

## Use the Agent component in a flow

The following steps explain how to create an agent flow in Langflow from a blank flow.
For a prebuilt example, use the **Simple Agent** template or the [Langflow quickstart](/get-started-quickstart).

1. Click **New Flow**, and then click **Blank Flow**.
2. Add an **Agent** component to your flow.
3. <PartialGlobalModelProviders />
4. Select the model that you want to use from the **Language Model** dropdown.
If your preferred model isn't listed, make sure it's enabled in the **Models** configuration.
For more information, see [Agent component parameters](#agent-component-parameters).
5. Add [**Chat Input** and **Chat Output** components](/chat-input-and-output) to your flow, and then connect them to the **Agent** component.

    At this point, you have created a basic LLM-based chat flow that you can test in the <Icon name="Play" aria-hidden="true" /> **Playground**.
    However, this flow only chats with the LLM.
    To enhance this flow and make it truly agentic, add some tools, as explained in the next steps.

6. Add **Web Search**, **URL**, and **Calculator** components to your flow.
7. Enable **Tool Mode** in the **Web Search**, **URL**, and **Calculator** components:

    1. Click the **Web Search** component to expose the [component's header menu](/concepts-components#component-menus), and then enable **Tool Mode**.
    2. Repeat for the **URL** and **Calculator** components.
    3. Connect the **Toolset** port for each tool component to the **Tools** port on the **Agent** component.

    **Tool Mode** makes a component into a tool by modifying the component's inputs.
    With **Tool Mode** enabled, a component can accept requests from an **Agent** component to use the component's available actions as tools.

    When in **Tool Mode**, a component has a **Toolset** port that you must connect to an **Agent** component's **Tools** port if you want to allow the agent to use that component's actions as tools.

    For more information, see [Configure tools for agents](/agents-tools).

8. Open the <Icon name="Play" aria-hidden="true" /> **Playground**, and then ask the agent, `What tools are you using to answer my questions?`

    The agent should respond with a list of the connected tools.
    It may also include built-in tools.

    ```text
    I use a combination of my built-in knowledge (up to June 2024) and a set of external tools to answer your questions. Here are the main types of tools I can use:
    Web Search & Content Fetching: I can fetch and summarize content from web pages, including crawling links recursively.
    News Search: I can search for recent news articles using Google News via RSS feeds.
    Calculator: I can perform arithmetic calculations and evaluate mathematical expressions.
    Date & Time: I can provide the current date and time in various time zones.
    These tools help me provide up-to-date information, perform calculations, and retrieve specific data from the internet when needed. If you have a specific question, let me know, and I'll use the most appropriate tool(s) to help!
    ```

9. To test a specific tool, ask the agent a question that uses one of the tools, such as `Summarize today's tech news`.

    To help you debug and test your flows, the **Playground** displays the agent's tool calls, the provided input, and the raw output the agent received before generating the summary.
    With the given example, the agent should call the **Web Search** component with **Search Mode** set to **News**.

You've successfully created a basic agent flow that uses some generic tools.

To continue building on this tutorial, try connecting other tool components or [use Langflow as an MCP client](/mcp-client) to support more complex and specialized tasks.

For a multi-agent example, see [Use an agent as a tool](/agents-tools#use-an-agent-as-a-tool).

## Agent component parameters

You can configure the **Agent** component to use your preferred provider and model, custom instructions, and tools.

<PartialParams />

### Provider and model

Use the **Language Model** (`agent_llm`) setting to select the LLM that you want the agent to use.

<PartialGlobalModelProviders />

To use a model with the **Agent** component, select the model in the **Agent** component's **Language Model** field.

The **Language Model** field lists all language models that you've configured globally. If a provider doesn't have any language models available, they aren't listed.
For example, if a provider offers only embeddings models, those models aren't listed on the **Agent** component.

To access other providers or models, you can do either of the following:

* Set **Model Provider** to **Connect other models** in the **Language Model** dropdown, and then connect any [language model component](/components-models). This option allows you to connect a custom language model component to use models that aren't available in the global model providers list.
* Configure additional providers in the **Models** pane, and then select the model from the **Language Model** dropdown.

If you need to generate embeddings in your flow, use an [embedding model component](/components-embedding-models).

### Agent instructions and input

In the **Agent Instructions** (`system_prompt`) field, you can provide custom instructions that you want the **Agent** component to use for every conversation.

These instructions are applied in addition to the **Input** (`input_value`), which can be entered directly or provided through another component, such as a **Chat Input** component.

### Tools

Agents are most useful when they have the appropriate tools available to complete requests.

An **Agent** component can use any Langflow component as a tool, including other agents and MCP servers.

To attach a component as a tool, you must enable **Tool Mode** on the component that you want to attach, and then attach it to the **Agent** component's **Tools** port.
For more information, see [Configure tools for agents](/agents-tools).

:::tip
To allow agents to use tools from MCP servers, use the [**MCP Tools** component](/mcp-tools).

### Agent memory

Langflow agents have built-in chat memory that is enabled by default.
This memory allows them to retrieve and reference messages from previous conversations, maintaining a rolling context window for each chat session ID.

Chat memories are grouped by [session ID (`session_id`)](/session-id).
It is recommended to use custom session IDs if you need to segregate chat memory for different users or applications that run the same flow.

By default, the **Agent** component uses your Langflow installation's storage, and it retrieves a limited number of chat messages, which you can configure with the **Number of Chat History Messages** parameter.

The **Message History** component isn't required for default chat memory, but it is required if you want to use external chat memory like Mem0.
Additionally, the **Message History** component provides more options for sorting, filtering, and limiting memories. Although, most of these options are built-in to the **Agent** component with default values.

For more information, see [Store chat memory](/memory#store-chat-memory) and [**Message History** component](/message-history).

### Additional parameters

With the **Agent** component, the available parameters can change depending on the selected provider and model, including support for additional modes, arguments, or features like chat memory and temperature.
For example:

* **Current Date** (`add_current_date_tool`): When enabled (`true`), this setting adds a tool to the agent that can retrieve the current date.
* **Handle Parse Errors** (`handle_parsing_errors`): When enabled (`true`), this setting allows the agent to fix errors, like typos, when analyzing user input.
* **Verbose** (`verbose`): When enabled (`true`), this setting records detailed logging output for debugging and analysis.

<PartialParams />

## Agent component output

The **Agent** component outputs a **Response** (`response`) that is [`Message` data](/data-types#message) containing the agent's raw response to the query.

Typically, this is passed to a **Chat Output** component to return the response in a human-readable format.
It can also be passed to other components if you need to process the response further before, or in addition to, returning it to the user.
