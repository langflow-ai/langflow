Because Langflow is based on LangChain, vector store components use an instance of [LangChain vector store](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/) to drive the underlying read and write functions.
These instances are provider-specific and configured according to the component's parameters, such as the connection string, index name, and schema.

In component code, this is often instantiated as `vector_store`, but some vector store components use a different name, such as the provider name.

Some LangChain classes don't expose all possible options as component parameters.
Depending on the provider, these options might use default values or allow modification through environment variables, if they are supported in Langflow.
For information about specific options, see the LangChain API reference and vector store provider's documentation.
