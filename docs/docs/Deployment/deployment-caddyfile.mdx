Learn how to deploy Langflow on your own remote server with secure web access.
This guide walks you through setting up Langflow on a remote server using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) and configuring secure web access with [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/docs/).

## Prerequisites

* A server with a dual-core CPU and at least 2 GB of RAM.
This example uses [Hetzner cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/) for hosting. Your deployment may vary.

## Connect to your remote server with SSH

1. Create an SSH key to connect to your server remotely.
For example:

    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "DANA@EXAMPLE.COM"
    ```

    Replace `DANA@EXAMPLE.COM` with the email address that you want to associate with the SSH key.

2. In your terminal, follow the instructions to create your SSH key pair.
This creates both a private and public key.
To copy the public key from your terminal, enter the following command:

    ```bash
    cat ~/Downloads/host-lf.pub | pbcopy
    ```

3. In your remote server, add the SSH key you copied in the previous step.
For example, if you are using a Hetzner cloud server, click **Server**, and then select **SSH keys** to add an SSH key.

4. To connect to your server with SSH, enter the following command.

    ```bash
    ssh -i PATH_TO_PRIVATE_KEY/PRIVATE_KEY_NAME root@SERVER_IP_ADDRESS
    ```

    Replace the following:

    * `PATH_TO_PRIVATE_KEY/PRIVATE_KEY_NAME`: The path to your private SSH key file that matches the public key you added to your server
    * `SERVER_IP_ADDRESS`: Your server's IP address

5. When prompted for a key fingerprint, type `yes`.

The terminal output indicates if the connection succeeds or fails.
The following response was returned after connecting to a Hetzner cloud server:

## Deploy Langflow on your server

Now that your local machine is connected to your remote server with SSH, you can install Docker, create a `docker-compose.yml` file, and serve it publicly with a reverse proxy, such as Caddy.

1. Install Docker on your server.

    Since this example server is an Ubuntu server, it can install snap packages.
    If you aren't using Ubuntu or you prefer a different installation method, see the [official Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) for instructions for your operating system.

    ```bash
    snap install docker
    ```

2. Create a file called `docker-compose.yml`, and then open it in a text editor:

    ```bash
    touch docker-compose.yml && nano docker-compose.yml
    ```

3. Add the following values to `docker-compose.yml`, and then save the file.

    The following example defines the Langflow service from the `langflow:latest` image and a Caddy service to expose Langflow through a reverse proxy.

    :::tip
    The [host-langflow](https://github.com/datastax/host-langflow) repository offers pre-built copies of this `docker-compose.yml` and `Caddyfile`, if you prefer to fork the repository to your server.
    :::

    ```yml
    version: "3.8"

    services:
      langflow:
        image: langflowai/langflow:latest
        ports:
          - "7860:7860"
        environment:
          - LANGFLOW_HOST=0.0.0.0
          - LANGFLOW_PORT=7860

      caddy:
        image: caddy:latest
        ports:
          - "80:80"
          - "443:443"
        volumes:
          - ./Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile
          - caddy_data:/data
          - caddy_config:/config
        depends_on:
          - langflow

    volumes:
      caddy_data:
      caddy_config:
    ```

4. Create a file called `Caddyfile`:

    ```bash
    touch Caddyfile && nano Caddyfile
    ```

5. Add the following values to `Caddyfile`, and then save the file.

    This Caddyfile configures Caddy to listen on port 80, and forward all incoming requests to port 80 to the Langflow service at port 7860.

    ```
    :80 {
        reverse_proxy langflow:7860
    }
    ```

6. To deploy your server, run `docker-compose up`.

    When the `Welcome to Langflow` message appears, Langflow is running and accessible internally at `http://0.0.0.0:7860` inside the Docker network.

7. To access your Langflow server over the public internet, navigate to your server's public IP address, such as `http://5.161.250.132`.
This address uses HTTP because HTTPS isn't enabled yet.

8. Recommended: Enable HTTPS:

    1. Modify your domain's A record to point to your server's IP address. For example:

        ```
        Type: A
        Name: langflow
        Value: 5.161.250.132  # Set to your server's IP address
        ```

    2. Stop your server.

    3. Modify your Caddyfile to include port `443` so Caddy can forward both HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) requests to the Langflow service:

        ```
        :80, :443 {
            reverse_proxy langflow:7860
        }
        ```

    4. Start your server.

        When users visit your domain, Caddy recognizes the incoming traffic and automatically routes it to your server with a secure, encrypted connection.

9. To exit your SSH session, type `exit`.
