Learn how to deploy Langflow on your own remote server with secure web access.
This guide walks you through setting up Langflow on a remote server using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) and configuring secure web access with [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/docs/).

:::tip
The [host-langflow](https://github.com/datastax/host-langflow) repository offers pre-built copies of this `docker-compose.yml` and `Caddyfile`, if you prefer to fork the repository to your server.

## Prerequisites

* A server with a dual-core CPU and at least 2 GB of RAM.
This example uses [Hetzner cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/) for hosting. Your deployment may vary.

## Connect to your remote server with SSH

1. Create an SSH key.
This key allows you to connect to your server remotely.
Replace `DANA@EXAMPLE.COM` with the email address you want to associate with the SSH key.
    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "DANA@EXAMPLE.COM"
    ```

2. In your terminal, follow the instructions to create your public key.
To copy the created key from your terminal, enter the following command:
    ```bash
    cat ~/Downloads/host-lf.pub | pbcopy
    ```
3. In your remote server, add the SSH key you copied in the previous step.
For example, in the Hetzner cloud server, click **Server** > **SSH keys**, and then click **Add SSH key**.
4. Paste your SSH key into the **SSH key** field, and then click **Enter**.
You can now use the SSH key stored on your local machine to connect to your remote server.
5. To connect to your server with SSH, enter the following command.
Replace `PATH_TO_PRIVATE_KEY/PRIVATE_KEY_NAME` with the path to your private SSH key.
Replace `SERVER_IP_ADDRESS` with your server's IP address.
    ```bash
    ssh -i PATH_TO_PRIVATE_KEY/PRIVATE_KEY_NAME root@SERVER_IP_ADDRESS
    ```
6. When prompted for a key fingerprint, type `yes`.
You are connected to your server.

    ```

## Deploy Langflow on your server

Now that your local machine is connected to your remote server with SSH, you can install Docker, create a `docker-compose.yml` file, and serve it publicly with Caddy as a reverse proxy.

1. Install Docker on your server.
Since this example server is an Ubuntu server, you can install snap packages.
If you are not using Ubuntu or prefer a different installation method, see the [official Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) for instructions for your operating system.
    ```bash
    snap install docker
    ```
2. Create a file called `docker-compose.yml`, and then open it in a text editor.
    ```bash
    touch docker-compose.yml && nano docker-compose.yml
    ```
    This file defines the Langflow service from the `langflow:latest` image, and a Caddy service to expose Langflow through a reverse proxy.

3. Add the following values to `docker-compose.yml`, and then save the file.
    ```yml
    version: "3.8"

    services:
      langflow:
        image: langflowai/langflow:latest
        ports:
          - "7860:7860"
        environment:
          - LANGFLOW_HOST=0.0.0.0
          - LANGFLOW_PORT=7860

      caddy:
        image: caddy:latest
        ports:
          - "80:80"
          - "443:443"
        volumes:
          - ./Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile
          - caddy_data:/data
          - caddy_config:/config
        depends_on:
          - langflow

    volumes:
      caddy_data:
      caddy_config:
    ```
4. Create a file called `Caddyfile`.
    ```bash
    touch Caddyfile && nano Caddyfile
    ```
5. Add the following values to `Caddyfile`, and then save the file.
The Caddyfile configures Caddy to listen on port `80`, and forward all incoming requests to port `80` to the Langflow service at port `7860`.
    ```
    :80 {
        reverse_proxy langflow:7860
    }
    ```
6. To deploy your server, enter `docker-compose up`.
When the `Welcome to Langflow` message appears, Langflow is running and accessible internally at `http://0.0.0.0:7860` inside the Docker network.
7. To open Langflow, navigate to your server's public IP address, such as `http://5.161.250.132`.
Your address must use `http`, because you haven't enabled HTTPS.
8. To enable HTTPS, modify your domain's A record to point to your server's IP address.
For example:
    ```
    Type: A
    Name: langflow
    Value: 5.161.250.132  (your server's IP address)
    ```
9. Stop your server.
10. Modify your Caddyfile to include port `443` for HTTPS.
Caddy will handle both HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) requests and them to the Langflow service.
When users visit your domain, Caddy will automatically redirect them to a secure, encrypted connection.
    ```
    :80, :443 {
        reverse_proxy langflow:7860
    }
    ```
11. Start your server.
Caddy recognizes the incoming traffic and routes it to your server.

To exit your SSH session, type `exit`.
