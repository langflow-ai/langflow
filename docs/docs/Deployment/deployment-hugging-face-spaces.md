HuggingFace provides a great alternative for running Langflow in their Spaces environment. This means you can run Langflow in the cloud without any local installation required. Here's how you can get Langflow up and running on HuggingFace Spaces:


1. **Access Langflow Space**: Open a Chromium-based browser and navigate to the [Langflow Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Langflow/Langflow?duplicate=true). This link directs you to a pre-configured environment for Langflow.


2. **Duplicate the Space**: You'll encounter an option to duplicate the Langflow space. This step involves a few simple decisions:

	- **Naming Your Space**: Assign a unique name to your new Space.
	- **Visibility Settings**: Choose between Public or Private visibility for your Space.
	- After setting these parameters, click on **Duplicate Space** to initiate the setup.
