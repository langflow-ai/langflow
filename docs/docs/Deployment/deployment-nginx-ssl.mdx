title: Deploy Langflow with Nginx and SSL
slug: /deployment-nginx-ssl
---

Deploy Langflow on a Linux-based virtual machine using Nginx as a reverse proxy and Certbot (Let's Encrypt) for HTTPS configuration.

## Prerequisites

- A server with a dual-core CPU and at least 2 GB of RAM
- Linux environment (Ubuntu/Debian-based systems)
- Domain configured via DNS to point to your virtual machine's public IP
- Root or sudo access to your server
- Ensure your domain's A record points to your VM's external IP address.
  For example, if your server's IP is `203.0.113.1`, configure your DNS:
  ```
  Type: A
  Name: langflow
  Value: 203.0.113.1
  ```

## Connect to your remote server with SSH

1. Create an SSH key to connect to your server remotely.
For example:

    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "DANA@EXAMPLE.COM"
    ```

    Replace `DANA@EXAMPLE.COM` with the email address that you want to associate with the SSH key.

2. In your terminal, follow the instructions to create your SSH key pair.
This creates both a private and public key.
To copy the public key from your terminal, enter the following command:

    ```bash
    cat ~/Downloads/host-lf.pub | pbcopy
    ```

3. In your remote server, add the SSH key you copied in the previous step.
For example, if you are using a Digital Ocean cloud server, add this SSH key when the server is created, or with the [Digital Ocean control panel](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/how-to/add-ssh-keys/).

4. To connect to your server with SSH, enter the following command.

    ```bash
    ssh -i PATH_TO_PRIVATE_KEY/PRIVATE_KEY_NAME root@SERVER_IP_ADDRESS
    ```

    Replace the following:

    * `PATH_TO_PRIVATE_KEY/PRIVATE_KEY_NAME`: The path to your private SSH key file that matches the public key you added to your server
    * `SERVER_IP_ADDRESS`: Your server's IP address

5. When prompted for a key fingerprint, type `yes`.

The terminal output indicates if the connection succeeds or fails.
The following response was returned after connecting to a Digital Ocean cloud server.

    ```text

      Swap usage:   0%                IPv4 address for eth0: 10.17.0.5
    ```

## Install Langflow on your virtual machine

With your connection with root permissions, install Langflow on your virtual machine.

1. Install Langflow on your virtual machine.
    ```bash
    # Update system packages
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

    # Install Python and pip
    sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv -y

    # Install uv (fast Python package installer)
    pip install uv

    # Create a virtual environment for Langflow
    python3 -m venv langflow-venv
    source langflow-venv/bin/activate

    # Install Langflow using uv
    uv pip install langflow
    ```

2. Optionally, start Langflow.
    ```
    uv run langflow run --host 127.0.0.1 --port 7860 &
    ```

    Test access at your `http://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:7860`.
    Since Langflow is running on `localhost`, you should not be successful.
    Instead, use Nginx as a reverse proxy to handle external access, and configure SSL for secure HTTPS access.

## Install Nginx

1. Install Nginx on your virtual machine.

    ```bash
    sudo apt install nginx -y
    ```

2. Start Nginx on your virtual machine.
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start nginx
    sudo systemctl enable nginx
    ```

    Result:
    ```
    Synchronizing state of nginx.service with SysV service script with /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install.
    Executing: /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install enable nginx
    ```

3. Create an Nginx configuration file.
Replace **DOMAIN_NAME** with your actual domain name, such as `langflow.example.com`.
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/DOMAIN_NAME
    ```

4. Paste the following content to the configuration file you created at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/DOMAIN_NAME`.
Replace **DOMAIN_NAME** with your actual domain name, such as `langflow.example.com`.
    ```nginx
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name DOMAIN_NAME;

        # Increase client body size for file uploads
        client_max_body_size 100M;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:7860/;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

            # WebSocket support for Langflow
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";

            # Timeout settings for long-running flows
            proxy_connect_timeout 60s;
            proxy_send_timeout 60s;
            proxy_read_timeout 300s;

            # Buffer settings
            proxy_buffering off;
            proxy_request_buffering off;
        }
    }
    ```

5. Create a symlink between the `/sites-available` and `/sites-enabled` directories to enable your site configuration.

    ```bash
    sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/DOMAIN_NAME /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/DOMAIN_NAME
    ```

6. Check the Nginx configuration file's syntax.
    ```
    sudo nginx -t
    ```

7. Restart Nginx.
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart nginx
    ```

## Install Certbot and obtain SSL certificates

1. Install Certbot and Nginx plugin.
```bash
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y
````

2. Obtain the SSL certificate for `DOMAIN_NAME` from Let's Encrypt.
    ```
    sudo certbot --nginx -d DOMAIN_NAME
    ```

3. Start Langflow from the virtual environment.
    ```bash
    # Activate the virtual environment
    source langflow-env/bin/activate

    # Start Langflow in the background
    langflow run --host 127.0.0.1 --port 7860 &
    ```

4. To test the deployment, navigate to `https://DOMAIN_NAME` in your browser.
5. Verify the SSL certificate is working.
