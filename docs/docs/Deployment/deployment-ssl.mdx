# Enabling SSL

This guide provides precise instructions for enabling SSL on your self-hosted Langflow instance across all platforms.

## Production Setup: Using Let's Encrypt

Let's Encrypt provides free TLS certificates to secure your Langflow deployment ("Encryption for Everybody" to more than 600M websites):

### 1. Install Certbot
```bash
# Linux/macOS
sudo apt install certbot  # Debian/Ubuntu
brew install certbot     # macOS

# Windows (run as Administrator)
choco install certbot
```

### 2. Obtain certificates
```bash
# All platforms (must have domain pointing to your server)
certbot certonly --standalone -d your-domain.com
```

### 3. Configure Langflow
```bash
langflow --ssl-cert-file-path /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/fullchain.pem \
         --ssl-key-file-path /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/privkey.pem
```

## Testing Setup: Self-Signed Certificates

For development/testing only:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
```

Then configure Langflow:
```bash
langflow --ssl-cert-file-path cert.pem --ssl-key-file-path key.pem
```

<Note>
  Browser warnings with self-signed certificates are expected. For production environments, always use certificates from trusted Certificate Authorities like Let's Encrypt.
</Note>

## Windows-Specific Implementation (Critical)

When running Langflow on Windows:

1. Langflow uses Uvicorn directly (without Gunicorn)
2. SSL **must** be explicitly configured
3. Without these parameters, Langflow will **only serve HTTP traffic**

### Required Steps for Windows:
1. Generate or obtain your SSL certificates
2. Always start Langflow with explicit SSL parameters:
   ```powershell
   langflow --ssl-cert-file-path "C:\path\to\certificate.crt" --ssl-key-file-path "C:\path\to\private.key"
   ```

### Path Formatting Tips:
- Use **forward slashes** (works best with Python tools):
  ```powershell
  langflow --ssl-cert-file-path C:/path/to/certificate.crt
  ```
- Or use **double backslashes**:
  ```powershell
  langflow --ssl-cert-file-path C:\\path\\to\\certificate.crt
  ```
- Or **quote paths with single backslashes**:
  ```powershell
  langflow --ssl-cert-file-path "C:\path\to\certificate.crt"
  ```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "File not found" | Verify exact paths to certificate and key files |
| "Permission denied" | Ensure Langflow process has read access to certificate files |
| Windows SSL not working | Double-check path formatting and run as Administrator if needed |
| Browser security warning | Expected for self-signed certificates; use trusted CA for production |

<Note>
  The environment variables <code>LANGFLOW_SSL_CERT_FILE</code> and <code>LANGFLOW_SSL_KEY_FILE</code> are not directly supported. Use CLI flags or set <code>ssl_cert_file</code> and <code>ssl_key_file</code> in your settings file.
