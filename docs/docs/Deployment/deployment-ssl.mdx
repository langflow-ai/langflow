# Enabling SSL

This guide will walk you through the process of enabling SSL on your self-hosted Langflow instance.

## Prerequisites

- A self-hosted Langflow instance.
- A domain name pointing to your server's IP address.
- A valid SSL certificate and private key. You can obtain a free certificate from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

## Configuration

You can enable SSL in Langflow using either environment variables or CLI flags.

### Using Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables:

- `LANGFLOW_SSL_CERT_FILE`: Path to your SSL certificate file.
- `LANGFLOW_SSL_KEY_FILE`: Path to your SSL private key file.

For example:

```bash
export LANGFLOW_SSL_CERT_FILE=/path/to/your/certificate.crt
export LANGFLOW_SSL_KEY_FILE=/path/to/your/private.key
langflow
```

### Using CLI Flags

You can also use the `--ssl-cert-file-path` and `--ssl-key-file-path` flags when starting Langflow:

```bash
langflow --ssl-cert-file-path /path/to/your/certificate.crt --ssl-key-file-path /path/to/your/private.key
```

## Generating a Self-Signed Certificate (for testing)

If you don't have a valid SSL certificate, you can generate a self-signed certificate for testing purposes using `openssl`:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
```

This will create two files: `cert.pem` (your certificate) and `key.pem` (your private key). You can then use these files with Langflow:

```bash
langflow --ssl-cert-file-path cert.pem --ssl-key-file-path key.pem
```

When you access your Langflow instance in your browser, you will likely see a warning that the certificate is not trusted. This is expected for self-signed certificates. You can choose to proceed to access your instance.

## Troubleshooting

- **"File not found" error**: Make sure the paths to your certificate and key files are correct.
- **"Permission denied" error**: Ensure that the user running Langflow has read permissions for the certificate and key files.
- **Browser warning**: If you are using a self-signed certificate, your browser will display a warning. This is normal. For production environments, it is highly recommended to use a valid certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
