This guide explains how to deploy Langflow on [Render](https://render.com/), a cloud platform for deploying web applications and APIs.

1. Prepare a Render instance that can support Langflow.

   Langflow requires at least 2 GB of RAM to run, so you must use a **Standard** or better Render instance type.
   This requires a paid Render account.
   For more information, see [Render Web Services](https://render.com/docs/web-services) and [Render pricing](https://render.com/pricing).

2. Click the following button to go to Render:

3. Enter a blueprint name, and then select the branch for your `render.yaml` file.

4. Click **Deploy Blueprint**, and then wait for the deployment to complete.
Once complete, your Langflow instance is ready to use.
