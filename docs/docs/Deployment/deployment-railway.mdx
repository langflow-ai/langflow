This guide explains how to deploy Langflow on [Railway](https://railway.com/?utm_medium=integration&utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=langflow), a cloud infrastructure platform that provides auto-deploy, managed databases, and automatic scaling.

1. Create a Railway account.

   Given the dual-core CPU and 2 GB RAM requirements, a Hobby account on Railway will be enough. For more information see [Railway pricing](https://railway.com/pricing?utm_medium=integration&utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=langflow).

2. Click the following button deploy on Railway:

3. (Optional) Add any custom configuration for Langflow you desire.

Railway automatically does the following:
   - Sets up the infrastructure.
   - Deploys Langflow.
   - Starts the application.

Wait for the deployment to complete.

Your Langflow instance is now ready to use. It is exposed on a public URL like `https://[your-app-name].up.railway.app`.
