3. (Optional) Customize your configuration:

   You can modify environment variables or link additional addons directly from your Northflank dashboard to fit your project’s requirements.

4. Wait for the deployment to complete:

   Northflank will automatically build, deploy, and start Langflow. Once the service status shows as “Running,” your instance is live.

5. Access your Langflow dashboard:

   Visit your deployment’s public URL, for example:  `https://p01--langflow-service--xyz123.code.run`

That’s it! You now have a fully functional Langflow instance running on Northflank — scalable, secure, and ready for production.
