# 🤖 Creating Flows

## Compose

Creating flows with LangFlow is easy. Drag sidebar components onto the canvas and connect them together to create your pipeline. LangFlow provides a range of [LangChain components](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/) to choose from, including LLMs, prompt serializers, agents, and chains.

  sources={{
    light: 'img/langflow_canvas.png',
  }}
/>


## Fork

The easiest way to start with LangFlow is by forking a **community example**. Forking an example stores a copy in your project collection, allowing you to edit and save the modified version as a new flow.

## Build

Building a flow means validating if the components have prerequisites fulfilled and are properly instantiated. When a chat message is sent, the flow will run for the first time, executing the pipeline.
