If you use a vector store component to query your vector database, it produces search results that you can pass to downstream components in your flow as a list of [`Data`](/data-types#data) objects or a tabular [`DataFrame`](/data-types#dataframe).
If both types are supported, you can set the format near the vector store component's output port in the visual editor.
