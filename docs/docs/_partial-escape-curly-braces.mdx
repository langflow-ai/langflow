If your template includes literal text and variables, you can use double curly braces to escape literal curly braces in the template and prevent interpretation of that text as a variable.
For example: `This is a template with {{literal text in curly braces}} and a {variable}`.

If your template contains many literal curly braces, such as JSON structures, consider using Mustache templating instead.
