Large Language Models, or LLMs, are part of an exciting new world in computing.


We made Langflow for anyone to create with LLMs, and hope you'll feel comfortable installing Langflow and [getting started](/getting-started-quickstart).


If you want to learn the basics of LLMs, prompt engineering, and AI models, Langflow recommends [promptingguide.ai](https://promptingguide.ai/), an open-source repository of prompt engineering content maintained by AI experts. PromptingGuide offers content for [beginners](https://www.promptingguide.ai/introduction/basics) and [experts](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/cot), as well as the latest [research papers](https://www.promptingguide.ai/papers) and [test results](https://www.promptingguide.ai/research) fueling AI's progress.


For in depth readings, we recommend [Awesome LLM Books](https://github.com/Hannibal046/Awesome-LLM?tab=readme-ov-file#llm-books), a curated list of resources for learning about LLMs and their applications.
