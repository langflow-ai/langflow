The **Playground** is a dynamic interface designed for real-time interaction with AIs, allowing users to chat, access memories and monitor inputs and outputs. Here, users can directly prototype and their models, making adjustments and observing different outcomes.


---


As long as you have an [Input or Output](/components-io) component working, you can open it up by clicking the **Playground** button.

>
> 💡  Notice how the **Playground's** window arrangement changes depending on what components are being used. Langflow can be used for applications that go beyond chat-based interfaces.
>


You can also open a flow's **Playground** without entering its workspace. From **My Collections** or **Langflow Store**, click the **Playground** in one of the projects card.

Whenever you send a message from the **Playground** interface, under the **Memories** **Tab** you'll see a table of previous interactions for that session.


---


Langflow allows every chat message to be stored, and a single flow can have multiple memory sessions. To learn more about how to use memories in Langflow, see [Chat Memory](/guides-chat-memory).
