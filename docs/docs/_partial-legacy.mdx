Legacy components are longer supported and can be removed in a future release.
You can continue to use them in existing flows, but it is recommended that you replace them with supported components as soon as possible.
Suggested replacements are included in the **Legacy** banner on components in your flows.
They are also given in release notes and Langflow documentation whenever possible.

If you aren't sure how to replace a legacy component, <Icon name="Search" aria-hidden="true" /> **Search** for components by provider, service, or component name.
The component may have been deprecated in favor of a completely new component, a similar component, or a new version of the same component in a different category.

If there is no obvious replacement, consider whether another component can be adapted to your use case.
For example, many <Icon name="Component" aria-hidden="true" /> **Core components** provide generic functionality that can support multiple providers and use cases, such as the [**API Request** component](/components-data#api-request).

If neither of these options are viable, you could use the legacy component's code to create your own custom component, or [start a discussion](/contributing-github-issues) about the legacy component.

To discourage use of legacy components in new flows, these components are hidden by default.
In the visual editor, you can click <Icon name="SlidersHorizontal" aria-hidden="true" /> **Component settings** to toggle the **Legacy** filter.
