# Component

Components are the building blocks of the flows. They are made of inputs, outputs, and parameters that define their functionality, providing a convenient and straightforward way to compose LLM-based applications. Learn more about components and how they work in the LangChain [documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/components) section.

### Component's Features

<div style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
  During the flow creation process, you will notice handles (colored circles)
  attached to one or both sides of a component. These handles represent the
  availability to connect to other components, while their colors are type hints
  (hover over a handle to see connection details).
</div>

<div style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
  For example, if you select a <code>ConversationChain</code> component, you
  will see orange <span style={{ color: "orange" }}>o</span> and purple{" "}
  <span style={{ color: "purple" }}>o</span> input handles. They indicate that
  this component accepts an LLM and a Memory component as inputs. The red
  asterisk <span style={{ color: "red" }}>*</span> means that at least one input
  of that type is required.
</div>

<ZoomableImage
  alt="Docusaurus themed image"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl("img/single-compenent.png"),
    dark: useBaseUrl("img/single-compenent.png"),
  }}
  style={{ width: "100%", maxWidth: "800px", margin: "20px auto" }}
/>

<div style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
  On the top right corner, you will find the component status icon 🔴. Make the
  necessary connections, build the flow (⚡ zap icon on the bottom right of the
  canvas) and once the validation is completed, the status of each validated
  component should light green 🟢. Hover over the component status to reveal the
  outputs going through it in case of success, or the detected error in case of
  failure.
</div>

### Component's Parameters

Langflow components can be edited in the component settings button. Hide parameters to reduce complexity and keep the canvas clean and intuitive for experimentation.
