# Playground

In Langflow 1.0 alpha, the **Playground** replaces the **Interaction Panel**.

The **Playground** provides an interface for interacting with flows without opening them in the flow editor.

It even works for flows hosted on the Langflow store!

As long as you have a flow's environment variables set, you can run it by clicking the **Playground** button.

1. From your **Collections** page, click the **![Playground icon](/logos/botmessage.svg)Playground** in one of your flows.
   The **Playground** window opens.

<ZoomableImage
  alt="Docusaurus themed image"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl("img/playground-chat.png"),
    dark: useBaseUrl("img/playground-chat.png"),
  }}
  style={{ width: "50%", maxWidth: "600px", margin: "0 auto" }}
/>

2. Chat with your bot as you normally would, all without having to open the editor.
