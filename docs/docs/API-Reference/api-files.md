Use the `/files` endpoints to move files between your local machine and Langflow.

## Differences between `/v1/files` and `/v2/files`

There are two versions of the `/files` endpoints.

`/v2/files` offers the following improvements over `/v1/files`:

- `/v2` files are organized by `user_id` instead of `flow_id`.
  This means files are owned by users, and they aren't attached to specific flows.
  You can upload a file to Langflow one time, and use it with multiple flows.
- `/v2` files are tracked in the Langflow database.
- `/v2` supports bulk upload and delete.
- `/v2` responses contain more descriptive metadata.
- `/v2` endpoints have more strict security, requiring authentication by an API key or JWT.

However, `/v2/files` doesn't support image files.
To send image files to your flows through the API, use [Upload image files (v1)](#upload-image-files-v1).

## Files/V1 endpoints

Use the `/files` endpoints to move files between your local machine and Langflow.

### Upload file (v1)

Upload a file to the `v1/files/upload/<YOUR-FLOW-ID>` endpoint of your flow.
Replace **FILE_NAME** with the uploaded file name.

<Tabs>

  <TabItem value="curl" label="curl" default>

```bash
curl -X POST \
  "$LANGFLOW_URL/api/v1/files/upload/$FLOW_ID" \
  -H "accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "file=@FILE_NAME.txt"
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="result" label="Result">

```json
{
  "flowId": "92f9a4c5-cfc8-4656-ae63-1f0881163c28",
  "file_path": "92f9a4c5-cfc8-4656-ae63-1f0881163c28/2024-12-30_15-19-43_your_file.txt"
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Upload image files (v1)

Send image files to the Langflow API for AI analysis.

The default file limit is 100 MB. To configure this value, change the `LANGFLOW_MAX_FILE_SIZE_UPLOAD` environment variable.
For more information, see [Supported environment variables](/environment-variables#supported-variables).

1. To send an image to your flow with the API, POST the image file to the `v1/files/upload/<YOUR-FLOW-ID>` endpoint of your flow.
   Replace **FILE_NAME** with the uploaded file name.

```bash
curl -X POST "$LANGFLOW_URL/api/v1/files/upload/a430cc57-06bb-4c11-be39-d3d4de68d2c4" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "file=@FILE_NAME.png"
```

The API returns the image file path in the format `"file_path":"<YOUR-FLOW-ID>/<TIMESTAMP>_<FILE-NAME>"}`.

```json
{
  "flowId": "a430cc57-06bb-4c11-be39-d3d4de68d2c4",
  "file_path": "a430cc57-06bb-4c11-be39-d3d4de68d2c4/2024-11-27_14-47-50_image-file.png"
}
```

<!-- TODO: What link goes here? -->
2. Post the image file to the **Chat Input** component of a **Basic prompting** flow.
   Pass the file path value as an input in the **Tweaks** section of the curl call to Langflow.
   Component `id` values can be found in [Langflow JSON files](/concepts-flows#langflow-json-file-contents).

```bash
curl -X POST \
    "$LANGFLOW_URL/api/v1/run/a430cc57-06bb-4c11-be39-d3d4de68d2c4?stream=false" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'\
    -d '{
    "output_type": "chat",
    "input_type": "chat",
    "tweaks": {
  "ChatInput-b67sL": {
    "files": "a430cc57-06bb-4c11-be39-d3d4de68d2c4/2024-11-27_14-47-50_image-file.png",
    "input_value": "what do you see?"
  }
}}'
```

Your chatbot describes the image file you sent.

## Files/V2 endpoints

Use the `/files` endpoints to move files between your local machine and Langflow.

The `v2` endpoints require authentication by an API key or JWT.
To create a Langflow API key and export it as an environment variable, see [Get started with the Langflow API](/api-reference-api-examples).

### Upload file (v2)

Upload a file to your user account. The file can be used across multiple flows.

The file is uploaded in the format `USER_ID/FILE_ID.FILE_EXTENSION`, such as `07e5b864-e367-4f52-b647-a48035ae7e5e/d44dc2e1-9ae9-4cf6-9114-8d34a6126c94.pdf`.

To retrieve your current `user_id`, call the `/whoami` endpoint.
```bash
curl -X GET \
  "$LANGFLOW_URL/api/v1/users/whoami" \
  -H "accept: application/json"
```

Result:
```
{"id":"07e5b864-e367-4f52-b647-a48035ae7e5e","username":"langflow","profile_image":null,"store_api_key":null,"is_active":true,"is_superuser":true,"create_at":"2025-05-08T17:59:07.855965","updated_at":"2025-05-28T19:00:42.556460","last_login_at":"2025-05-28T19:00:42.554338","optins":{"github_starred":false,"dialog_dismissed":true,"discord_clicked":false,"mcp_dialog_dismissed":true}}
```

In the POST request to `v2/files`, replace **@FILE_NAME.EXTENSION** with the uploaded file name and its extension.
You must include the ampersand (`@`) in the request to instruct curl to upload the contents of the file, not the string `FILE_NAME.EXTENSION`.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  "$LANGFLOW_URL/api/v2/files" \
  -H "accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -H "x-api-key: $LANGFLOW_API_KEY" \
  -F "file=@FILE_NAME.EXTENSION"
```

The file is uploaded in the format `USER_ID/FILE_ID.FILE_EXTENSION`, and the API returns metadata about the uploaded file:

```json
{
  "id":"d44dc2e1-9ae9-4cf6-9114-8d34a6126c94",
  "name":"engine_manual",
  "path":"07e5b864-e367-4f52-b647-a48035ae7e5e/d44dc2e1-9ae9-4cf6-9114-8d34a6126c94.pdf",
  "size":851160,
  "provider":null
}
```

### Send files to your flows (v2)

:::important
The `/v2/files` endpoint does not support sending **image** files to flows.
To send **image** files to your flows through the API, follow the procedure in [Upload image files (v1)](#upload-image-files-v1).
:::

Send a file to your flow for analysis using the [File](/components-data#file) component and the API.
Your flow must contain a [File](/components-data#file) component to receive the file.

The default file limit is 100 MB. To configure this value, change the `LANGFLOW_MAX_FILE_SIZE_UPLOAD` environment variable.
For more information, see [Supported environment variables](/environment-variables#supported-variables).

1. To send a file to your flow with the API, POST the file to the `/api/v2/files` endpoint.
   Replace **FILE_NAME** with the uploaded file name.
   This is the same step described in [Upload file (v2)](#upload-file-v2), but since you need the filename to upload to your flow, it is included here.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  "$LANGFLOW_URL/api/v2/files" \
  -H "accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -H "x-api-key: $LANGFLOW_API_KEY" \
  -F "file=@FILE_NAME.EXTENSION"
```

The file is uploaded in the format `USER_ID/FILE_ID.FILE_EXTENSION`, and the API returns metadata about the uploaded file:

```json
{
  "id":"d44dc2e1-9ae9-4cf6-9114-8d34a6126c94",
  "name":"engine_manual",
  "path":"07e5b864-e367-4f52-b647-a48035ae7e5e/d44dc2e1-9ae9-4cf6-9114-8d34a6126c94.pdf",
  "size":851160,
  "provider": null
}
```

2. To use this file in your flow, add a [File](/components-data#file) component to load a file into the flow.
3. To load the file into your flow, send it to the **File** component.
To retrieve the **File** component's full name with the UUID attached, call the [Read flow](/api-flows#read-flow) endpoint, and then include your **File** component and the file path as a tweak with the `/v1/run` POST request.
In this example, the file uploaded to `/v2/files` is included with the `/v1/run` POST request.

```text
curl --request POST \
  --url "$LANGFLOW_URL/api/v1/run/$FLOW_ID" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
  "input_value": "what do you see?",
  "output_type": "chat",
  "input_type": "text",
  "tweaks": {
    "File-1olS3": {
      "path": [
        "07e5b864-e367-4f52-b647-a48035ae7e5e/3a290013-fe1e-4d3d-a454-cacae81288f3.pdf"
      ]
    }
  }
}'
```

Result:
```text
"text":"This document provides important safety information and instructions for selecting, installing, and operating Briggs & Stratton engines. It includes warnings and guidelines to prevent injury, fire, or damage, such as choosing the correct engine model, proper installation procedures, safe fuel handling, and correct engine operation.
