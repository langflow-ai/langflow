title: Monitor endpoints
slug: /api-monitor
---

The `/monitor` endpoints are for internal Langflow functionality, primarily related to running flows in the **Playground**, storing chat history, and generating flow logs.

This information is primarily for those who are building custom components or contributing to the Langflow codebase in a way that requires calling or understanding these endpoints.

For typical application development with Langflow, there are more appropriate options for monitoring, debugging, and memory management.
For more information, see the following:

* [Logs](/logging): Langflow log storage locations, customization options, and where to view logs in the visual editor
* [Test flows in the Playground](/concepts-playground): Run flows and inspect message history
* [Memory management options](/memory): Langflow storage locations and options, including the database, cache, and chat history

## Vertex builds

The Vertex build endpoints (`/monitor/builds`) are exclusively for **Playground** functionality.

When you run a flow in the **Playground**, Langflow calls the `/build/$FLOW_ID/flow` endpoint in [chat.py](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow/blob/main/src/backend/base/langflow/api/v1/chat.py#L143). This call retrieves the flow data, builds a graph, and executes the graph. As each component (or node) is executed, the `build_vertex` function calls `build_and_run`, which may call the individual components' `def_build` method, if it exists. If a component doesn't have a `def_build` function, the build still returns a component.

The `build` function allows components to execute logic at runtime. For example, the [**Recursive Character Text Splitter** component](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow/blob/main/src/backend/base/langflow/components/langchain_utilities/recursive_character.py) is a child of the `LCTextSplitterComponent` class. When text needs to be processed, the parent class's `build` method is called, which creates a `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` object and uses it to split the text according to the defined parameters. The split text is then passed on to the next component. This all occurs when the component is built.

### Get Vertex builds

Retrieve Vertex builds for a specific flow.

```bash
curl -X GET \
  "$LANGFLOW_URL/api/v1/monitor/builds?flow_id=$FLOW_ID" \
  -H "accept: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $LANGFLOW_API_KEY"
```

### Delete Vertex builds

Delete Vertex builds for a specific flow.

```bash
curl -X DELETE \
  "$LANGFLOW_URL/api/v1/monitor/builds?flow_id=$FLOW_ID" \
  -H "accept: */*" \
  -H "x-api-key: $LANGFLOW_API_KEY"
```

## Messages endpoints

The `/monitor/messages` endpoints store, retrieve, edit, and delete records in the message table in [`langflow.db`](/memory)
Typically, these are called implicitly when running flows that produce message history, or when inspecting and modifying **Playground** memories.

### Get messages

Retrieve a list of all messages:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  "$LANGFLOW_URL/api/v1/monitor/messages" \
  -H "accept: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $LANGFLOW_API_KEY"
```

To filter messages, use the `flow_id`, `session_id`, `sender`, and `sender_name` query parameters.

To sort the results, use the `order_by` query parameter.

This example retrieves messages sent by `Machine` and `AI` in a given chat session (`session_id`) and orders the messages by timestamp.

```bash
curl -X GET \
  "$LANGFLOW_URL/api/v1/monitor/messages?flow_id=$FLOW_ID&session_id=01ce083d-748b-4b8d-97b6-33adbb6a528a&sender=Machine&sender_name=AI&order_by=timestamp" \
  -H "accept: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $LANGFLOW_API_KEY"
```

### Delete messages

Delete specific messages by their IDs.

This example deletes the message retrieved in the previous `GET /messages` example.

```bash
curl -v -X DELETE \
  "$LANGFLOW_URL/api/v1/monitor/messages" \
  -H "accept: */*" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $LANGFLOW_API_KEY" \

### Update message

This example updates the `text` value of message `3ab66cc6-c048-48f8-ab07-570f5af7b160`.

```bash
curl -X PUT \
  "$LANGFLOW_URL/api/v1/monitor/messages/3ab66cc6-c048-48f8-ab07-570f5af7b160" \
  -H "accept: application/json" \
