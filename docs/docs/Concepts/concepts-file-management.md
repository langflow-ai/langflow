Upload, store, and manage files in Langflow's **File management** system.

Uploading files to the **File management** system keeps your files in a central location, and allows you to re-use files across flows without repeated manual uploads.

## Upload a file

The **File management** system is available at the `/files` URL. For example, if you're running Langflow at the default `http://127.0.0.1:7860` address, the **File management** system is located at `http://127.0.0.1:7860/files`.

To upload a file from your local machine:

1. From the **My Files** window at `http://127.0.0.1:7860/files`, click **Upload**.
2. Select the file to upload.
The file is uploaded to Langflow.

Files stored in **My Files** can be renamed, downloaded, duplicated, or deleted.

Files are available to flows stored in different folders.

## Use uploaded files in a flow

To use your uploaded files in flows:

1. Include the [File](/components-data#file) component in a flow.
2. To select a document to load, in the **File** component, click the **Select files** button.
3. Select a file to upload, and then click **Select file**. The loaded file name appears in the component.

For an example of using the **File** component in a flow, see the [Document QA tutorial project](/document-qa).

:::note
If you prefer a one-time upload, the [File](/components-data#file) component still allows one-time uploads directly from your local machine.
