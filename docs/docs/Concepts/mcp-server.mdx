Langflow integrates with the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) as both an MCP server and an MCP client.

This page describes how to use Langflow as an MCP server that exposes your flows as [tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools) that [MCP clients](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients) can use when generating responses.

For information about using Langflow as an MCP client and managing MCP server connections within flows, see [Use Langflow as an MCP client](/mcp-client).

## Prerequisites

* A [Langflow project](/concepts-flows#projects) with at least one flow that has a [**Chat Output** component](/components-io#chat-output).

    The **Chat Output** component is required to use a flow as an MCP tool.

* Any LTS version of [Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) installed on your computer if you want to use MCP Inspector to [test and debug flows](#test-and-debug-flows).

* [ngrok installed](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/#1-install-ngrok) and an [ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) if you want to [deploy a public Langflow server](/deployment-public-server).

## Serve flows as MCP tools {#select-flows-to-serve}

Each [Langflow project](/concepts-flows#projects) has an MCP server that exposes the project's flows as tools for use by MCP clients.

By default, all flows in a project are exposed as tools on the project's MCP server.
You can change the exposed flows and tool metadata by managing the MCP server settings:

1. Click the **MCP Server** tab on the [**Projects** page](/concepts-flows#projects), or, when editing a flow, click **Share**, and then select **MCP Server**.

    ![MCP server projects page](/img/mcp-server.png)

    The **Flows/Tools** section lists the flows that are currently being served as tools on this MCP server.

2. To toggle exposed flows, click <Icon name="Settings2" aria-hidden="true"/> **Edit Tools**, and then select the flows that you want exposed as tools.
To prevent a flow from being used as a tool, clear the checkbox in the first column.

3. Close the **MCP Server Tools** dialog to save your changes.

    ![MCP Server Tools](/img/mcp-server-tools.png)

### Edit flow tool names and descriptions

Tool names and descriptions help MCP clients determine which actions your flows provide and when to use those actions.
It is recommended to provide clear, descriptive names and descriptions for all tools that you serve to MCP clients.

To edit the names and descriptions of flow tools on a Langflow MCP server, do the following:

1. Click the **MCP Server** tab on the [**Projects** page](/concepts-flows#projects), or, when editing a flow, click **Share**, and then select **MCP Server**.

2. Click <Icon name="Settings2" aria-hidden="true"/> **Edit Tools**.

3. Click the **Description** or **Tool** that you want to edit:

    - **Tool name**: Enter a name that makes it clear what the flow does when used as a tool by an agent.

    - **Tool description**: Enter a description that completely and accurately describes the specific actions the flow performs.

4. Close the **MCP Server Tools** dialog to save your changes.

#### Importance of tool names and descriptions

MCP clients use tool names and descriptions to determine which actions to use when generating responses.

Because MCP clients treat your Langflow project as a single MCP server with all of your enabled flows listed as tools, unclear names and descriptions can cause the agent to select tools incorrectly or inconsistently.

For example, a flow's default tool name is the flow ID, such as `adbbf8c7-0a34-493b-90ea-5e8b42f78b66`.
This provides no information to an agent about the type of flow or it's purpose.

To provide more context about your flows, make sure to name and describe your flows clearly when configuring your Langflow project's MCP server.

Think of these names and descriptions as function names and code comments.
Use clear statements to describe the problems your flows solve.

<details>
<summary>Example: Tool name and description usage</summary>

For example, assume you create a flow based on the **Document Q&A** template that uses an LLM to chat about resumes, and then you give the flow the following name and description:

- **Tool name**: `document_qa_for_resume`

- **Tool description**: `A flow for analyzing Emily's resume.`

After connecting your Langflow MCP server to Cursor, you can ask Cursor about the resume, such as `What job experience does Emily have?`.
Using the context provided by your tool name and description, the agent can decide to use the `document_qa_for_resume` MCP tool to create a response about Emily's resume.
If necessary, the agent asks permission to use the flow tool before generating the response.

If you ask about a different resume, such as `What job experience does Alex have?`, the agent can decide that `document_qa_for_resume` isn't relevant to this request, because the tool description specifies that the flow is for Emily's resume.
In this case, the agent might use another available tool, or it can inform you that it doesn't have access to information about Alex's.
For example:

```
I notice you're asking about Alex's job experience.
Based on the available tools, I can see there is a Document QA for Resume flow that's designed for analyzing resumes.
However, the description mentions it's for "Emily's resume" not Alex's. I don't have access to Alex's resume or job experience information.
```

## Connect clients to your Langflow MCP server {#connect-clients-to-use-the-servers-actions}

Langflow provides automatic installation and code snippets to help you deploy your Langflow MCP servers to your local MCP clients.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="auto" label="Auto install" default>

1. Install [Cursor](https://docs.cursor.com/get-started/installation), [Claude](https://claude.ai/download), or [Windsurf](https://windsurf.com/download/editor) on the same computer where your Langflow server is running.

    :::info
    The auto install option is available only for specific MCP clients.
    Auto install requires the client to be installed locally so Langflow can automatically update the client's configuration files.
    If your client isn't supported or is installed remotely, use the **JSON** option.
    :::

2. Recommended: Configure [authentication](#authentication) for your MCP server.

3. In Langflow, on the **Projects** page, click the **MCP Server** tab.

4. On the **Auto install** tab, find your MCP client provider, and then click <Icon name="Plus" aria-hidden="true"/> **Add**.

    Your Langflow project's MCP server is automatically added to the configuration file for your local Cursor, Claude, or Windsurf client.
    For example, with Cursor, the server configuration is added to the `mcp.json` configuration file.

    Langflow attempts to add this configuration even if the selected client isn't installed.
    To verify the installation, check the available MCP servers in your client.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="JSON" label="JSON">

The JSON option allows you to connect a Langflow MCP server to any local or remote MCP client.
You can modify this process for any [MCP-compatible client](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients).

1. Install any [MCP-compatible client](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients).

    These steps use Cursor as an example, but the process is generally the same for all clients, with slight differences in client-specific details like file names.

2. In your client, add a new MCP server using the client's UI or configuration file.

    For example, in Cursor, go to **Cursor Settings**, select **MCP**, and then click **Add New Global MCP Server** to open Cursor's global `mcp.json` configuration file.

3. Recommended: Configure [authentication](#authentication) for your MCP server.

4. In Langflow, on the **Projects** page, click the **MCP Server** tab.

5. Click the **JSON** tab, copy the code snippet for your operating system, and then paste it into your client's MCP configuration file.
For example:

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "PROJECT_NAME": {
          "command": "uvx",
          "args": [
            "mcp-proxy",
            "http://LANGFLOW_SERVER_ADDRESS/api/v1/mcp/project/PROJECT_ID/sse"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    The **MCP Server** tab automatically populates the `PROJECT_NAME`, `LANGFLOW_SERVER_ADDRESS`, and `PROJECT_ID` values.

    The default Langflow server address is `http://localhost:7860`.
    If you are using a [public Langflow server](/deployment-public-server), the server address is automatically included.

    If your Langflow server requires authentication, you must include your Langflow API key or OAuth settings in the configuration.
    For more information, see [MCP server authentication and environment variables](#authentication).

6. Save and close your client's MCP configuration file.

7. Confirm that your Langflow MCP server is on the client's list of MCP servers.
If necessary, restart your client to apply the modified configuration file.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once your MCP client is connected to your Langflow project's MCP server, your flows are registered as tools.
Cursor determines when to use tools based on your queries, and requests permissions when necessary.
For more information, see the MCP documentation for your client, such as [Cursor's MCP documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol).

### MCP server authentication and environment variables {#authentication}

Each [Langflow project](/concepts-flows#projects) has its own MCP server with it's own MCP server authentication settings.

Langflow MCP servers support these authentication types.

To configure authentication for a Langflow MCP server, go to the **Projects** page in Langflow, click the **MCP Server** tab, click <Icon name="Fingerprint" aria-hidden="true"/> **Add Auth**, and then select your preferred authentication method:

<Tabs groupId="auth-type">
<TabItem value="API key" label="API key">

When authenticating your MCP server with an Langflow API key, the code template in your project's **MCP Server** tab automatically includes the `--headers` and `x-api-key` arguments.

Click <Icon name="key" aria-hidden="true"/> **Generate API key** to automatically insert a new Langflow API key into the code template.
Alternatively, you can replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with an existing Langflow API key.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="OAuth" label="OAuth">

When OAuth is enabled, Langflow automatically starts an [MCP Composer](https://pypi.org/project/mcp-composer) instance for your project, creating a secure proxy between MCP clients and the `mcp-proxy` in front of your server.

To configure OAuth authentication:

1. Select **OAuth** as the authentication type.
2. Configure the OAuth settings with the values from your OAuth deployment:

   - **Host**: OAuth server host
   - **Port**: OAuth server port
   - **Server URL**: Full OAuth server URL
   - **Callback Path**: OAuth callback URL
   - **Client ID**: Your OAuth client identifier
   - **Client Secret**: Your OAuth client secret
   - **Authorization URL**: OAuth authorization endpoint
   - **Token URL**: OAuth token endpoint
   - **MCP Scope**: Scope for MCP operations
   - **Provider Scope**: OAuth provider scope

    The OAuth credentials are encrypted and stored securely in your Langflow database.

3. To complete server setup, click **Save**.
Your MCP server's JSON configuration is updated with OAuth values.

    An OAuth callback page will now appear each time your MCP client attempts to authenticate with the server.
    A successful authentication displays `Authentication complete. You may close this window.`

4. After enabling OAuth, you need to update your MCP client configuration to use the new OAuth settings.
    The client update method depends on how the client was installed.

    - **Auto install**: Manually update your client's config file using the updated JSON snippet from the **JSON** tab, or repeat the steps in [Auto-install](#connect-clients-to-use-the-servers-actions) to re-install the client with the updated settings.
    - **JSON option**: Copy the updated JSON snippet from the **JSON** tab and replace your existing configuration.
    - **New connections**: Use either **Auto install** or **JSON** option. The OAuth settings are included automatically.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="None" label="None">

When no authentication is configured, your MCP server becomes a public endpoint that anyone can access without providing credentials.
Only use this option when Langflow is running in a trusted environment.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Environment Variables

To include other environment variables with your MCP server command, use the `env` object with key-value pairs of environment variables:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "PROJECT_NAME": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-proxy",
        "--headers",
        "x-api-key",
        "YOUR_API_KEY",
        "http://LANGFLOW_SERVER_ADDRESS/api/v1/mcp/project/PROJECT_ID/sse"
      ],
      "env": {
        "KEY": "VALUE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Use MCP Inspector to test and debug flows {#test-and-debug-flows}

:::info Node prerequisite
MCP Inspector requires any LTS version of [Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) installed on your computer.
:::
[MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) is a common tool for testing and debugging MCP servers.
You can use MCP Inspector to monitor your flows and get insights into how they are being consumed by the MCP server.

1. Install MCP Inspector:

    ```bash
    npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
    ```

    For more information about configuring MCP Inspector, including specifying a proxy port, see the [MCP Inspector GitHub project](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector).

2. Open a web browser and navigate to the MCP Inspector UI.
The default address is `http://localhost:6274`.

3. In the MCP Inspector UI, enter the connection details for your Langflow project's MCP server.
    The field values depend on your server's method of [authentication](#authentication).

## Troubleshoot Langflow MCP servers {#troubleshooting-mcp-server}

If Claude for Desktop isn't using your server's tools correctly, you may need to explicitly define the path to your local `uvx` or `npx` executable file in the `claude_desktop_config.json` configuration file.

1. To find your UVX path, run `which uvx`.

    To find your NPX path, run `which npx`.

2. Copy the path, and then replace `PATH_TO_UVX` or `PATH_TO_NPX` in your `claude_desktop_config.json` file.
