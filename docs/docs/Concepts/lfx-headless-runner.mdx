title: Run flows with Langflow Executor (LFX)
slug: /lfx-headless-runner
---

The Langflow Executor (LFX) is a command-line tool that serves and runs flows statelessly from [flow JSON files](/concepts-flows-import) with minimal dependencies.

Flows are run without the flow builder UI or database, and any flow dependencies are automatically added to complete the run.
The flow graph is stored in memory at all times, so there is less overhead for loading the graph from a database.

LFX includes two commands for executing flows.

* [`lfx serve`](#serve): This command starts a FastAPI server with your flow available at `/flows/{flow_id}/run`.
The actual value for `flow_id` is displayed when the server starts.
* [`lfx run`](#run): This command executes a flow with input text and returns the results to `stdout`.

## Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- A [flow JSON file](/concepts-flows)

## Install LFX

LFX is included with the [Langflow installation](/get-started-installation) in the`langflow/src/lfx` directory, or can be installed as a [PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/lfx/).

If you already have the Langflow OSS package installed, you don't need to install any additional dependencies.
To use LFX commands, change directory to `langflow/src/lfx` and run the `uv run lfx` commands from there.
For example:

```
cd langflow/src/lfx
uv run lfx serve my_flow.json
```

### LFX Python package

To install LFX globally as a standalone [PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/lfx/):

```
uv pip install lfx
```

To run LFX with `uvx` without installing the package locally:

```
uvx lfx run my_flow.json "message"
```

## Serve a flow with `lfx serve` {#serve}

To serve your flow as a REST API endpoint, set your `LANGFLOW_API_KEY` and run the flow JSON.
If you're running Langflow from source, remember to first change directory to `langflow/src/lfx` and run the `uv run lfx` commands from there.

1. Export your API key.
    ```
    export LANGFLOW_API_KEY="sk..."
    ```
2. Start the server.
    ```
    uv run lfx serve simple_chat.json --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    ```

3. The startup process returns a `flow_id` value.
Copy the value to use in the test API call in the next step.
    ```
    Flow ID: af9edd65-6393-58e2-9ae5-d5f012e714f4
    ```
4. Test the server with an API call to the `/flows/flow_id/run` endpoint:
    ```
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/flows/FLOW_ID/run \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "x-api-key: LANGFLOW_API_KEY" \
      -d '{"input_value": "Hello, world!"}'
    ```

    If your exported flow includes [global variables](/configuration-global-variables), such as an Open AI API key, you need to create a variable in your `.env` file with the same name, and add your value to the `.env` file.
    
    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY="sk..."
    ```
    
    Start LFX with the path to your `.env` file:
    
    ```
    uv run lfx serve --env-file .env
    ```

### LFX serve options

**Table: Command-line options for `lfx serve`**
| Option                                 | Description                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--host`, `-h`                         | Host to bind server. Default: `127.0.0.1`.                                                  |
| `--port`, `-p`                         | Port to bind server. Default:`8000`.                                                         |
| `--verbose`, `-v`                      | Display diagnostic output.                                                                        |
| `--env-file`                           | The path to the `.env` file.                                                                           |
| `--log-level`                          | Set logging level. Options are `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, or `critical`.                           |
| `--check-variables`/`--no-check-variables` | Check global variables for environment compatibility. Default: `check`.

## Run a flow with `lfx run` {#run}

The `lfx run` command runs a flow from a JSON file without serving it, and the output is sent to `stdout`.
Input to `lfx run` can be a path to the JSON file, inline JSON passed with `--input-value`, or read from `stdin`.

To run the flow from a JSON file with an input message, run:
    ```
    uv run lfx run my_flow.json "your input message"
    ```

If the flow expects structured input, pass it as a JSON string.
You can provide the input as a positional argument or with the `--input-value` flag.
The `--input-value` flag is especially useful for structured input, as it avoids ambiguity.
    ```
    uv run lfx run my_flow.json --input-value '{"question": "What is the weather in Paris?", "context": "weather"}'
    ```

To run a flow from `stdin` and extract the `result` field from the output, run the `lfx run` command with additional options:
    ```
    cat my_flow.json | uv run lfx run --stdin --format json | jq '.result'
    ```
