Langflow provides several ways to publish and integrate your flows into external applications. Whether you want to expose your flow as an API endpoint, embed it as a chat widget in your website, or share it as a public playground, this guide covers the options available for making your flows accessible to users.

## API access

:::tip Windows
The paths generated by the API access pane assume a *nix environment.
If you use Microsoft Windows or WSL, you might need to adjust the filepaths given in the code snippets.
:::

The **API access** pane presents code templates for integrating your flow into external applications.
Langflow provides code snippets to help you get started with the Langflow API.

As of Langflow version 1.5, all API requests require authentication with a Langflow API key, even if `AUTO_LOGIN` is set to `True`.
For more information, see [API keys](/configuration-api-keys).
The API access pane’s code snippets include a script that looks for a `LANGFLOW_API_KEY` environment variable set in your terminal session.
To set this variable in your terminal:
```bash
export LANGFLOW_API_KEY="sk..."
```

For more information, see [Run your flows from external applications](/get-started-quickstart#run-your-flows-from-external-applications).

### Input schema

Tweaks are added to the `payload` of requests to Langflow's `/run` endpoint to temporarily change component parameters within your flow.
They don't modify the underlying flow configuration or persist between runs.
To assist with formatting, you can define tweaks in Langflow's **Input Schema** pane before copying the code snippet.

For more information, see [Use tweaks to apply temporary overrides to a flow run](/get-started-quickstart#use-tweaks-to-apply-temporary-overrides-to-a-flow-run).

Additionally, you can re-name your flow's API endpoint from the default UUID to a more memorable and user-friendly name.

To set a custom endpoint name:
1. In the **Input Schema** pane, locate the **Endpoint Name** field.
2. Enter a name using only letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores.
The endpoint name is automatically saved with your flow.

## Export

**Export** a flow to download it as a JSON file to your local machine.

1. To **Export** your flow, in the **Playground**, click **Share**, and then click **Export**.
2. To save your API keys with the flow, select **Save with my API keys**.
Your flow is saved with any Global variables included.

:::important
If your key is saved as a Global variable, only the global variable you created to contain the value is saved. If your key value is manually entered into a component field, the actual key value is saved in the JSON file.
:::

When you share your flow file with another user who has the same global variables populated, the flow runs without requiring keys to be added again.

The `FLOW_NAME.json` file is downloaded to your local machine.

You can then **Import** the downloaded flow into another Langflow instance.

## MCP server

**MCP server** exposes your flows as [tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools) that [MCP clients](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients) can use to take actions.

For more information, see [MCP server](/mcp-server).

For information about using Langflow as an *MCP client*, see [MCP client](/mcp-client).

## Embed into site

The **Embed into site** tab displays code that can be inserted in the `<body>` of your HTML to interact with your flow.

For more information, see [Embedded chat widget](/embedded-chat-widget).

## Shareable playground

The **Shareable playground** exposes your Langflow application's **Playground** at the `/public_flow/$FLOW_ID` endpoint.

You can share this endpoint publicly using a sharing platform like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/?os=macos) or [zrok](https://docs.zrok.io/docs/getting-started).
