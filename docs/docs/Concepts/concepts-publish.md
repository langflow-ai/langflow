Langflow provides several ways to publish and integrate your flows into external applications. Whether you want to expose your flow as an API endpoint, embed it as a chat widget in your website, or share it as a public playground, this guide covers the options available for making your flows accessible to users.

## API access

The **API access** pane presents code templates for integrating your flow into external applications.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="Python" label="Python">

The **Python** tab displays code to interact with your flow using the Python `requests` library.

1. Copy and paste the code into a Python script.
2. Run the script.

```python
python3 python-test-script.py --message="tell me about something interesting"
```

The response content depends on your flow. Make sure the endpoint returns a successful response.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="JavaScript" label="JavaScript" default>

The **JavaScript API** tab displays code to interact with your flow in JavaScript.

1. Copy and paste the code into a JavaScript file.
2. Run the script.

```text
node test-script.js "tell me about something interesting"
```

The response content depends on your flow. Make sure the endpoint returns a successful response.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="curl" label="curl" default>

The **cURL** tab displays sample code for posting a query to your flow.

Copy the code and run it to post a query to your flow and get the result.

The response content depends on your flow. Make sure the endpoint returns a successful response.

</Tabs>

### Temporary overrides

The **Temporary overrides** tab displays the available parameters for your flow.
Modifying the parameters changes the code parameters across all windows.
For example, changing the **Chat Input** component's `input_value` changes that value across all API calls to the `/run` endpoint of this flow.

### Send files to your flow with the API

For information on sending files to the Langflow API, see [API examples](/api-reference-api-examples#upload-image-files-v1).

## Shareable playground

The **Shareable playground** exposes your Langflow application's **Playground** at the `/public_flow/{flow-id}` endpoint.

You can share this endpoint publicly using a sharing platform like [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/?os=macos) or [zrok](https://docs.zrok.io/docs/getting-started).

If you're using **Datastax Langflow**, you can share the URL with any users within your **Organization**.

## Embed into site

The **Embed into site** tab displays code that can be inserted in the `<body>` of your HTML to interact with your flow.

For more information, see [Embedded chat widget](/embedded-chat-widget).
