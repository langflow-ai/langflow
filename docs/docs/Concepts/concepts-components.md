# Langflow components overview

A component is a single building block within a flow with inputs, outputs, functions, and parameters that define its functionality. A single component is like a class within a larger application.

To add a component to a flow, drag it from the **Component** menu to the **Workspace**.

Learn more about components and how they work on this page.

## Component menu

Each component is unique, but all have a menu bar at the top that looks something like the following:

<img src="/img/openai-model-component.png" alt="Open AI component" style={{display: 'block', margin: 'auto', width: 300}} />

Use the component controls to do the following:

- **Code** — Modify the component's Python code and save your changes.
- **Controls** — Adjust all component parameters.
- **Freeze Path** — After a component runs, lock its previous output state to prevent it from re-running.

Click <Icon name="Ellipsis" aria-label="Horizontal ellipsis" /> **All** to see additional options for a component.

To view a component’s output and logs, click the <Icon name="View" aria-label="View icon" />**Visibility** icon.

To run a single component, click <Icon name="Play" aria-label="Play button" /> **Play**.

A <Icon name="Check" aria-label="Checkmark" />**Checkmark** indicates that the component ran successfully.

Running a single component with the **Play** button is different from running the entire flow. In a single component run, the `build_vertex` function is called, which builds and runs only the single component with direct inputs provided through the UI (the `inputs_dict` parameter). The  `VertexBuildResult` data is passed to the `build_and_run` method, which calls the component's `build` method and runs it. Unlike running the full flow, running a single component does not automatically execute its upstream dependencies.

## Component ports

Handles (<Icon name="Circle" size="16" aria-label="A circle on the side of a component" />) on the side of a component indicate the types of inputs and outputs that can be connected at that port. Hover over a handle to see connection details.

### Component port data type colors

The following table lists the handle colors and their corresponding data types:

| Data type | Handle color | Hex code |

| BaseLanguageModel | Fuchsia | #c026d3 |
| Data | Red | #dc2626 |
| Document | Lime | #65a30d |
| Embeddings | Emerald | #10b981 |

| unknown | Gray | #9CA3AF |

## Component code

A component inherits from a base `Component` class that defines its interface and behavior.

For example, the [Recursive character text splitter](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow/blob/main/src/backend/base/langflow/components/langchain_utilities/recursive_character.py) is a child of the [LCTextSplitterComponent](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow/blob/main/src/backend/base/langflow/base/textsplitters/model.py) class.

```python
from typing import Any

from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, TextSplitter

from langflow.base.textsplitters.model import LCTextSplitterComponent
from langflow.inputs.inputs import DataInput, IntInput, MessageTextInput
from langflow.utils.util import unescape_string

class RecursiveCharacterTextSplitterComponent(LCTextSplitterComponent):
    display_name: str = "Recursive Character Text Splitter"
    description: str = "Split text trying to keep all related text together."
    documentation: str = "https://docs.langflow.org/components-processing"
    name = "RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter"
    icon = "LangChain"

    inputs = [
        IntInput(
            name="chunk_size",
            display_name="Chunk Size",
            info="The maximum length of each chunk.",
            value=1000,
        ),
        IntInput(
            name="chunk_overlap",
            display_name="Chunk Overlap",
            info="The amount of overlap between chunks.",
            value=200,
        ),
        DataInput(
            name="data_input",
            display_name="Input",
            info="The texts to split.",
            input_types=["Document", "Data"],
        ),
        MessageTextInput(
            name="separators",
            display_name="Separators",
            info='The characters to split on.\nIf left empty defaults to ["\\n\\n", "\\n", " ", ""].',
            is_list=True,
        ),
    ]

    def get_data_input(self) -> Any:
        return self.data_input

    def build_text_splitter(self) -> TextSplitter:
        if not self.separators:
            separators: list[str] | None = None
        else:
            # check if the separators list has escaped characters
            # if there are escaped characters, unescape them
            separators = [unescape_string(x) for x in self.separators]

        return RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
            separators=separators,
            chunk_size=self.chunk_size,
            chunk_overlap=self.chunk_overlap,
        )

```

Components include definitions for inputs and outputs, which are represented in the UI with color-coded ports.

**Input Definition:** Each input (like `IntInput` or `DataInput`) specifies an input's type, name, and display properties, which appear as configurable fields in the component's UI panel.

**Methods:** Components have methods or functions that handle their functionality. This component has two methods.
`get_data_input` retrieves the text data to be split from the component's input. This makes the data available to the class.
`build_text_splitter` creates a `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` object by calling its parent class's `build` method. The text is split with the created splitter and passed to the next component.
When used in a flow, this component:

1. Displays its configuration options in the UI.
2. Validates user inputs based on the input types.
3. Processes data using the configured parameters.
4. Passes results to the next component.

## Freeze path

After a component runs, **Freeze Path** locks the component's previous output state to prevent it from re-running.

If you’re expecting consistent output from a component and don’t need to re-run it, click **Freeze Path**. 

Enabling **Freeze Path** freezes all components upstream of the selected component.

If you only want to freeze a single component, select **Freeze** instead.

A <Icon name="Snowflake" aria-label="Snowflake"/> icon appears on all frozen components.

## Additional component options

Click <Icon name="Ellipsis" aria-label="Horizontal ellipsis" /> **All** to see additional options for a component.

To modify a component's name or description, double-click in the **Name** or **Description** fields. Component descriptions accept Markdown syntax.

## Group components in the workspace

Multiple components can be grouped into a single component for reuse. This is useful when combining large flows into single components, for example RAG with a vector database, and saving space.

1. Hold **Shift** and drag to select components.
2. Select **Group**.
The components merge into a single component.
3. Double-click the name and description to change them.
4. Save your grouped component to the sidebar for later use.

## Component version

A component's initial state is stored in a database. As soon as you drag a component from the sidebar to the workspace, the two components are no longer in parity.

A component keeps the version number it is initialized to the workspace with. If a component is at version `1.0` when it is dragged to the workspace, it will stay at version `1.0` until you update it.

Langflow notifies you when a component's workspace version is behind the database version and an update is available.
Click the <Icon name="AlertTriangle" aria-label="Exclamation mark" /> **Update Component** icon to update the component to the `latest` version. This will change the code of the component in place so you can validate that the component was updated by checking its Python code before and after updating it.

## Components sidebar

Components are listed in the sidebar by component type.

Component **bundles** are components grouped by provider. For example, Langchain modules like **RunnableExecutor** and **CharacterTextSplitter** are grouped under the **Langchain** bundle.

The sidebar includes a component **Search** bar, and includes flags for showing or hiding **Beta** and **Legacy** components.

**Beta** components are still being tested and are not suitable for production workloads.

**Legacy** components are available to use but no longer supported.
