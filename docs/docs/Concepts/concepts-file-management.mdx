Each Langflow server has a file management system where you can store files that you want to use in your flows.

Files uploaded to Langflow file management are stored locally to your Langflow server, and they are available to all of your flows.

Uploading files to Langflow file management keeps your files in a central location, and allows you to reuse files across flows without repeated manual uploads.

## Use the file management UI

You can use the file management UI to upload files from your local machine to your own Langflow server.
You can also manage all files that have been uploaded to your Langflow server.

1. Navigate to Langflow file management:

    * In the Langflow UI, on the [**Projects** page](#projects) page, click **My Files** below the list of projects.
    * From a browser, navigate to your Langflow server's `/files` endpoint, such as `http://localhost:7860/files`. Modify the base URL as needed for your Langflow server.
    * For programmatic file management, use the [Langflow API files endpoints](/api-files). However, the following steps assume you're using the file management UI.

2. On the **My Files** page, click **Upload**.

3. Select one or more files to upload.

After uploading files, you can rename, download, copy, or delete files within the file management UI:

* To delete a file, hover over a file's icon, select it, and then click <Icon name="Trash2" aria-hidden="true"/> **Delete**.
You can delete multiple files in a single action.

* To download a file, hover over a file's icon, select it, and then click <Icon name="Download" aria-hidden="true"/> **Download**.
If you download multiple files in a single action, they are saved together in a zip file.

## Upload and manage files with the Langflow API

With the Langflow API, you can upload and manage files in Langflow file management, and you can send files to flows programmatically at runtime.

For more information and examples, see [Files endpoints](/api-files) and [Create a chatbot that can ingest files](/chat-with-files).

## Use files in a flow

To use files in your Langflow file management system in a flow, add a component that accepts file input to your flow, such as the **File** component.

For example, add a **File** component to your flow, click **Select files**, and then select files from the **My Files** list.

This list includes all files in your server's file management system, but you can only select [file types that are supported by the **File** component](/components-data#file).
If you need another file type, you must use a different component that supports that file type, or you need to convert it to a supported type before uploading it.

For more information about the **File** component and other data loading components, see [Data components](/components-data).

### Load files at runtime

You can use preloaded files in your flows, and you can load files at runtime, if your flow accepts file input.
For an example, see [Create a chatbot that can ingest files](/chat-with-files).

## Upload images

Langflow supports base64 images in the following formats:

* PNG
* JPG/JPEG
* GIF
* BMP
* WebP

You can upload images to the **Playground** chat interface and as runtime input with the Langflow API.

* In the **Playground**, you can drag-and-drop images into the chat input area, or you can click the **Attach image** icon to select an image to upload.

* When you trigger a flow with the `/api/v1/run/$FLOW_ID` endpoint, you can use the `files` parameter to attach the base64-encoded image data to the request payload:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://$LANGFLOW_SERVER_ADDRESS/api/v1/run/$FLOW_ID" \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -H "x-api-key: $LANGFLOW_API_KEY" \
   -d '{
      "session_id": "custom_session_123",
      "input_value": "What is in this image?",
      "input_type": "chat",
      "output_type": "chat",
      "files": ["data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA..."]
   }'
   ```

For more specialized image processing, browse third-party [bundles](/components-bundle-components) or [create your own components](/components-custom-components).

## Work with video files

For videos, see the **Twelve Labs** and **YouTube** [bundles](/components-bundle-components) in the Langflow **Components** menu.

## Set the maximum file size

By default, the maximum file size is 100 MB.
To modify this value, change the [`--max-file-size-upload` environment variable](/environment-variables#LANGFLOW_MAX_FILE_SIZE_UPLOAD).
