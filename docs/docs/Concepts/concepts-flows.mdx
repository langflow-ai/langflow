A _flow_ is a functional representation of an application workflow.
Flows receive input, process it, and produce output.

Flows consist of _components_ that represent individual steps in your application's workflow.

Langflow flows are fully serializable and can be saved and loaded from the file system where Langflow is installed.

:::tip
To try building and running a flow in a few minutes, see the [Langflow quickstart](/get-started-quickstart).

## Create a flow

From the [**Projects** page](#projects), there are four ways to create a flow:

* **Create a blank flow**: Select a project, click **New Flow**, and then click **Blank Flow**.

* **Create a flow from a template**: Select a project, click **New Flow**, and then click the template that you want to use.

    <details>
    <summary>What are templates?</summary>

    Templates are pre-built flows that you can use as a starting point for your own flow.
    They range from basic flows with a few components to complex flows with many components and sub-flows.

    For example, the **Basic Prompting** template demonstrates a small flow that passes both chat input and pre-defined instructions (as a prompt) to an LLM.
    In contrast, the **Vector Store RAG** template consists of two sub-flows that demonstrate how to create a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot. One sub-flow populates the vector store with contextually relevant data and embeddings, and the other sub-flow queries the vector store for similar data to answer user questions.

    You can also [contribute templates](/contributing-templates) to the Langflow codebase.

* **Duplicate an existing flow**: Locate the flow you want to copy, click <Icon name="Ellipsis" aria-hidden="true" /> **More**, and then select **Duplicate**.

* **Import a flow**: See [Import and export flows](/concepts-flows-import).

You can also create a flow with the [Langflow API](/api-flows), but the Langflow team recommends using the [visual editor](/concepts-overview) until you are familiar with flow creation.

### Add components

Flows consist of [components](/concepts-components), which are nodes that you configure and connect in the [workspace](/concepts-overview#workspace).
Each component performs a specific task, like serving an AI model or connecting a data source.

Drag and drop components from the **Components** menu to add them to your flow.
Then, configure the component settings and connect the components together.

Each component has configuration settings and options. Some of these are common to all components, and some are unique to specific components.

To form a cohesive flow, you connect components by _edges_ or _ports_, which have a specific data type they receive or send.
For example, message ports send text strings between components.

For more information about component configuration, including port types and underlying component code, see [Components overview](/concepts-components).

### Run a flow

After you build a prototype flow, you can test it in the [**Playground**](/concepts-playground).
When you're ready to use Langflow for application development, learn how to [trigger flows with the Langflow API](/concepts-publish), explore more advanced configuration options like [custom dependencies](/install-custom-dependencies), and, eventually, [containerize your Langflow application](/develop-application).

When you're ready to go to production or deploy a Langflow MCP server for access over the public internet, see [Langflow deployment overview](/deployment-overview).

#### Flow graphs

When a flow runs, Langflow builds a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) object from the nodes (components) and edges (connections), and the nodes are sorted to determine the order of execution.

The graph build calls each component's `def_build` function to validate and prepare the nodes.
This graph is then processed in dependency order.
Each node is built and executed sequentially, with results from each built node being passed to nodes that are dependent on that node's results.

## Manage flows in projects {#projects}

The **Projects** page is where you arrive when you launch Langflow.
From here, you can manage flows and your projects' [MCP servers](/mcp-server).

Langflow projects are like folders that you can use to organize related flows.
The default project is **Starter Project**, and your flows are stored here unless you create another project.
To create a project, click <Icon name="Plus" aria-hidden="true"/> **Create new project**.

:::tip
To get back to the **Projects** page after editing a flow, click the project name or Langflow icon in the Langflow header.

### Edit flow details

1. On the **Projects** page, locate the flow you want to edit.
2. Click <Icon name="Ellipsis" aria-hidden="true" /> **More**, and then select **Edit details**.
3. Edit the **Name** and **Description**, and then click **Save**.

### Delete a flow

1. On the **Projects** page, locate the flow you want to delete.
2. Click <Icon name="Ellipsis" aria-hidden="true" /> **More**, and then select **Delete**.

## Flow storage and logs

By default, flows and flow execution data are stored in a SQLite database at the following locations.
<PartialDBDirPaths/>

The database storage location can be customized using the `LANGFLOW_CONFIG_DIR` and `LANGFLOW_SAVE_DB_IN_CONFIG_DIR` environment variables. The config directory can be customized with the `LANGFLOW_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable.

Langflow logs are stored in the config directory specified in the `LANGFLOW_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable.
<PartialConfigDirPaths/>

For more information, see [Memory management options](/memory) and [Logging](/logging).
