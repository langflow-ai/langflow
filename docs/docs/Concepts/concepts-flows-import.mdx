You can export flows to transfer them between Langflow instances, share them with others, or create backups.

## Export a flow

There are three ways to export flows:

* **Export from projects**: On the [**Projects** page](/concepts-flows#projects), find the flow you want to export, click <Icon name="Ellipsis" aria-hidden="true" /> **More**, and then select **Export**. To export all flows in a project, click <Icon name="Ellipsis" aria-hidden="true" /> **Options** on the **Projects** list, and then select **Download**.

* **Export by sharing**: When editing a flow, click **Share**, and then click **Export**.

* **Export with the Langflow API**: To export one flow, use the [`/flows/download`](/api-flows#export-flows) endpoint. 
To export all flows in a project, use the [`/projects/download`](/api-projects#export-a-project) endpoint.

Exported flows are downloaded to your local machine as JSON files named `FLOW_NAME.json`.
If you export an entire project, the JSON files are packaged in a zip archive.
For more information, see [Langflow JSON file contents](#langflow-json-file-contents).

### Save with my API keys

When exporting from the **Projects** page or **Share** menu, you can select **Save with my API keys** to export the flow _and_ any defined API key variables.
Non-API key variables are included in the export regardless of the **Save with my API keys** setting.

:::warning
If you enter the literal key into a component's **API key** field, then **Save with my API keys** exports the literal key value.

If your key is stored in a Langflow global variable, **Save with my API keys** exports only the variable name.
:::

When you or another user import the flow to another Langflow instance, that instance must have Langflow global variables with the same names and valid values in order to run the flow successfully.
If any variables are missing or invalid, those variables must be created or edited after importing the flow.

## Import a flow

You can import Langflow JSON files from your local machine in the following ways:

* **Import to projects**: On the **Projects** page, click <Icon name="Upload" aria-hidden="true"/> **Upload a flow**, and then select the Langflow JSON file to import.
* **Import anywhere**: Drag and drop Langflow JSON files from your file explorer into your Langflow window to import a flow from any Langflow page.
* **Import with the Langflow API**: To import one Langflow JSON file, use the [`/flows/upload/`](/api-flows#import-flows) endpoint.
To import a zip archive of Langflow JSON files, use the [`/projects/upload`](/api-projects#import-a-project) endpoint.

### Run an imported flow

Once imported, your flow is ready to use.
If the flow contains any global variables, make sure your Langflow instance has global variables with the same names and valid values.
For more information, see [Save with my API keys](/concepts-flows-import#save-with-my-api-keys).

## Langflow JSON file contents

An exported flow is downloaded to your local machine as a JSON file named `FLOW_NAME.json`.

Langflow JSON files contain [nodes](#nodes) and [edges](#edges) that describe components and connections, and [additional metadata](#additional-metadata-and-project-information) that describe the flow.

For an example Langflow JSON file, examine the [Basic Prompting.json](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow/blob/main/src/backend/base/langflow/initial_setup/starter_projects/Basic%20Prompting.json) file in the Langflow repository.

### Nodes

Nodes represent the components that make up the flow.
For example, this object represents a **Chat Input** component:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "description": "Get chat inputs from the Playground.",
    "display_name": "Chat Input",
    "id": "ChatInput-jFwUm",
    "node": {
      "base_classes": ["Message"],
      "description": "Get chat inputs from the Playground.",
      "display_name": "Chat Input",
      "icon": "MessagesSquare",
      "template": {
        "input_value": {
          "display_name": "Text",
          "info": "Message to be passed as input.",
          "value": "Hello"
        },
        "sender": {
          "value": "User",
          "options": ["Machine", "User"]
        },
        "sender_name": {
          "value": "User"
        },
        "should_store_message": {
          "value": true
        }
      }
    },
    "type": "ChatInput"
  },
  "position": {
    "x": 689.5720422421635,
    "y": 765.155834131403
  }
}
```

Each node has a unique identifier in the format of `NODE_NAME-UUID`, such as `ChatInput-jFwUm`.

Entrypoint nodes, such as the `ChatInput` node, are the first node executed when running a flow.

### Edges

Edges represent the connections between nodes.

The connection between the `ChatInput` node and the `OpenAIModel` node is represented as an edge:

```json
{
  "className": "",
  "data": {
    "sourceHandle": {
      "dataType": "ChatInput",
      "id": "ChatInput-jFwUm",
      "name": "message",
      "output_types": ["Message"]
    },
    "targetHandle": {
      "fieldName": "input_value",
      "id": "OpenAIModel-OcXkl",
      "inputTypes": ["Message"],
      "type": "str"
    }
  },
  "id": "reactflow__edge-ChatInput-jFwUm{≈ìdataType≈ì:≈ìChatInput≈ì,≈ìid≈ì:≈ìChatInput-jFwUm≈ì,≈ìname≈ì:≈ìmessage≈ì,≈ìoutput_types≈ì:[≈ìMessage≈ì]}-OpenAIModel-OcXkl{≈ìfieldName≈ì:≈ìinput_value≈ì,≈ìid≈ì:≈ìOpenAIModel-OcXkl≈ì,≈ìinputTypes≈ì:[≈ìMessage≈ì],≈ìtype≈ì:≈ìstr≈ì}",
  "source": "ChatInput-jFwUm",
  "sourceHandle": "{≈ìdataType≈ì: ≈ìChatInput≈ì, ≈ìid≈ì: ≈ìChatInput-jFwUm≈ì, ≈ìname≈ì: ≈ìmessage≈ì, ≈ìoutput_types≈ì: [≈ìMessage≈ì]}",
  "target": "OpenAIModel-OcXkl",
  "targetHandle": "{≈ìfieldName≈ì: ≈ìinput_value≈ì, ≈ìid≈ì: ≈ìOpenAIModel-OcXkl≈ì, ≈ìinputTypes≈ì: [≈ìMessage≈ì], ≈ìtype≈ì: ≈ìstr≈ì}"
}
```

This edge shows that the `ChatInput` component outputs a `Message` type to the `target` node, which is the `OpenAIModel` node.
The `OpenAIModel` component accepts the `Message` type at the `input_value` field.

### Additional metadata and project information

Additional information about the flow is stored in the root `data` object.

* Metadata and project information including the name, description, and `last_tested_version` of the flow:

    ```json
    {
      "name": "Basic Prompting",
      "description": "Perform basic prompting with an OpenAI model.",
      "tags": ["chatbots"],
      "id": "1511c230-d446-43a7-bfc3-539e69ce05b8",
      "last_tested_version": "1.0.19.post2",
      "gradient": "2",
      "icon": "Braces"
    }
    ```

* Visual information about the flow defining the initial position of the flow in the workspace:

    ```json
    "viewport": {
      "x": -37.61270157375441,
      "y": -155.91266341888854,
      "zoom": 0.7575251406952855
    }
    ```

* Notes are comments that help you understand the flow within the workspace.
They may contain links, code snippets, and other information.
Notes are written in Markdown and stored as `node` objects.

    ```json
    {
      "id": "undefined-kVLkG",
      "node": {
        "description": "## üìñ README\nPerform basic prompting with an OpenAI model.\n\n#### Quick Start\n- Add your **OpenAI API key** to the **OpenAI Model**\n- Open the **Playground** to chat with your bot.\n..."
      }
    }
    ```
