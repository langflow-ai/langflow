A knowledge base is a repository of vector embeddings created from your data that agents can reference to answer domain-specific questions.
Knowledge bases are distinct from vector store components because the vector data is stored locally, and can be re-used without requiring re-ingestion of the data in every flow.
You create a new knowledge base with the [**Create Knowledge**](/components-data#create-knowledge) component, and then retrieve knowledge using the [**Retrieve Knowledge**](/components-data#retrieve-knowledge) component.

For example, you could create a knowledge base with customer sales data from a specific month.
Then, whenever you create flows that need customer data from this time period, add a [**Retrieve Knowledge**](/components-data#retrieve-knowledge) component to your flow to access the knowledge base.

## Create knowledge

To view your available Knowledge bases, click <Icon name="Books" aria-hidden="true"/> **Knowledge**.

1. To create a new knowledge base, click <Icon name="Add" aria-hidden="true"/> **Create Knowledge**.
You can also create new knowledge bases with the <Icon name="Add" aria-hidden="true"/> **New Knowledge** option in the **Create Knowledge** component.
2. In the **Knowledge Base** field, select an existing Knowledge Base, or select <Icon name="Add" aria-hidden="true"/> **New knowledge**.
The **Create new knowledge base** pane, and then click **Create**.

    * **Knowledge Base Name**: The name of your knowledge base
    * **Model Name**: The embedding model for embedding your vector data.
    * **API Key**: The API key for your embedding model.

On Mac, knowledge base files are stored at `home/.langflow/knowledge_bases`.
The contents of a knowledge_base folder are:

    ```text
    knowledge_base/
      ├── schema.json
      ├── source.parquet
      └── vectors.py
    ```

### Retrieve the contents of a knowledge base using the Retrieve KB component
