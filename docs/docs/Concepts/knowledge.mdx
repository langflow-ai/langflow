Vector data is critical to AI applications.
Langflow provides several components to help you store and retrieve vector data in your flows, including embedding modles, vector stores, and knowledge bases.

## Embedding models

Embedding model components generate text embeddings using a specified Large Language Model (LLM).

There are two common use cases for these components:

* **Store vectors**: Generate embeddings for content written to a vector database.
* **Search vectors**: Generate an embedding from a query to run a similarity search.

In both cases the embedding model component is attached to a vector store component.
For more information, examples, and available options, see [Embedding model components](/components-embedding-models).

Alternatively, you can use [knowledge bases](#knowledge-bases), which include built-in support for several embedding models.

## Vector stores

Vector store components read and write to vector databases.
Typically, these components connect to remote databases, but some vector store components support local databases.
