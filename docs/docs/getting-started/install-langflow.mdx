<Admonition type="info">
  Langflow **requires** Python version 3.10 or greater and
  [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) or
  [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/) to be installed on your
  system.
</Admonition>

Install Langflow with pip:

```bash
python -m pip install langflow -U
```

Install Langflow with pipx:

```bash
pipx install langflow --python python3.10 --fetch-missing-python
```

Pipx can fetch the missing Python version for you with `--fetch-missing-python`, but you can also install the Python version manually. Use `--force-reinstall` to ensure you have the latest version of Langflow and its dependencies.

1. **Access Langflow Space**: Open a Chromium-based browser and navigate to the [Langflow Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Langflow/Langflow?duplicate=true). This link directs you to a pre-configured environment for Langflow.

2. **Duplicate the Space**: You'll encounter an option to duplicate the Langflow space. This step involves a few simple decisions:
   - **Naming Your Space**: Assign a unique name to your new Space.
   - **Visibility Settings**: Choose between Public or Private visibility for your Space.
   - After setting these parameters, click on **Duplicate Space** to initiate the setup.
