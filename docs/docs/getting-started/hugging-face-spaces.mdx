# 🚀 Getting Started

HuggingFace provides great support for running Langflow in their Spaces environment. This means you can run Langflow without any installation required.

The first step is to go to the [Langflow Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Logspace/Langflow?duplicate=true).

You'll be greeted with the following screen:

<ZoomableImage
  alt="Docusaurus themed image"
  sources={{
    light: "img/duplicate-space.png",
    dark: "img/duplicate-space.png",
  }}
  style={{ width: "100%" }}
/>

From here, you can rename your Space, define the visibility (Public or Private) and click on the `Duplicate Space` button to start the duplication process.

import ThemedImage from "@theme/ThemedImage";
import useBaseUrl from "@docusaurus/useBaseUrl";
import ZoomableImage from "/src/theme/ZoomableImage.js";
