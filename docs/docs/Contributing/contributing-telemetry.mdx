Langflow uses anonymous telemetry to collect essential usage statistics to enhance functionality and the user experience. This data helps us identify popular features and areas that need improvement, and ensures development efforts align with what you need.

We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your data. We do not collect any personal information or sensitive data. All telemetry data is anonymized and used solely for improving Langflow.

## Opt out of telemetry

To opt out of telemetry, set the `LANGFLOW_DO_NOT_TRACK` or `DO_NOT_TRACK` environment variable to `true` before running Langflow. This disables telemetry data collection.
