1. Fork the [Langflow repository](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow) on GitHub.
2. Add your `template.json` file to the Langflow repository's [starter_projects](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow/tree/main/src/backend/base/langflow/initial_setup/starter_projects) folder in your fork.
3. Include the [Required items for template submission](#required-items-for-template-submission) listed below.
4. Create a Pull Request from your fork to the main Langflow repository.
5. Include a screenshot of your template in the PR.

The Langflow team will review your PR, offer feedback, and merge the template.

## Required items for template submission

Include the following items and follow these guidelines when submitting your template.

### Name
The template name must be concise and contain no more than three words.
Capitalize only the first letter of each word.
For example: **Blog Writer** or **Travel Planning Agent**.

### Description
The description is displayed in the UI to guide users to your template.
The description should be brief and informative, and describe what the template does and its intended use cases.
For example:```json  "description": "Auto-generate a customized blog post from instructions and referenced articles.",```

### Icons

Use icons from the [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/icons/) icon library.

### Flow
Use only the components that are available in the sidebar.
Do not use custom components.

Include a note to guide users. Notes accept Markdown syntax.
A single note usually suffices.

  For example:
  ```text
  # Financial Assistant Agents
