:::important
The **NVIDIA G-Assist** component is available only for Langflow users with NVIDIA GPUs on Windows systems.
:::

The **NVIDIA G-Assist** component enables interaction with NVIDIA GPU drivers through natural language prompts.
For example, prompt G-Assist with `"What is my current GPU temperature?"` or `"Show me the available GPU memory"` to get information, and then tell G-Assist to modify your GPU settings.
For more information, see the [NVIDIA G-Assist repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/g-assist).

## Prerequisites

* Windows operating system
* NVIDIA GPU
* `gassist.rise` package installed. This package is included in your [Langflow installation](/get-started-installation).

## Use the G-Assist component in a flow

1. Create a flow with **Chat Input** component, **G-Assist** component, and **Chat Output** components.
2. Connect the **Chat Input** component to the **G-Assist** component's **Prompt** input.
3. Connect the **G-Assist** component's output to the **Chat Output** component.
4. Open the **Playground**, and then ask a question about your GPU. For example, `"What is my current GPU temperature?"`.
The **G-Assist** component queries your GPU, and the response appears in the **Playground**.

### Inputs

The **NVIDIA G-Assist** component accepts a single input:

- `prompt`: A human-readable prompt processed by NVIDIA G-Assist.

### Outputs

The **NVIDIA G-Assist** component outputs a [`Message`](/data-types#message) object that contains the NVIDIA G-Assist response.
The string response with the completed operation result is available in the `text` field of the `Message` object.
