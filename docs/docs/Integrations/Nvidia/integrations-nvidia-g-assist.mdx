title: Integrate NVIDIA G-Assist with Langflow
slug: /integrations-nvidia-g-assist
---

The **NVIDIA System-Assist** component integrates your flows with NVIDIA G-Assist, enabling interaction with NVIDIA GPU drivers through natural language prompts.
For example, prompt G-Assist with `"What is my current GPU temperature?"` or `"Show me the available GPU memory"` to get information, and then tell G-Assist to modify your GPU settings.
For more information, see the [NVIDIA G-Assist repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/g-assist).

## Prerequisites

The **NVIDIA System-Assist** component requires an NVIDIA GPU on a Windows operating system.

It uses the `gassist.rise` package, which is installed with all Langflow versions that include this component.

## Use NVIDIA G-Assist in a flow

1. Create a flow with a **Chat Input** component, **NVIDIA System-Assist** component, and **Chat Output** components.

    This is a simplified example that uses only three components.
    Depending on your use case, your flow might use more components or different inputs and outputs.

2. Connect the **Chat Input** component to the **NVIDIA System-Assist** component's **Prompt** input.

    The **Prompt** parameter accepts a natural language prompt that is processed by the NVIDIA G-Assist AI Assistant.
    In this example, you'll provide the prompt as chat input.
    You could also enter a prompt directly in the **Prompt** input or connect another input component.

3. Connect the **NVIDIA System-Assist** component's output to the **Chat Output** component.

4. To test the flow, open the **Playground**, and then ask a question about your GPU.
For example, `"What is my current GPU temperature?"`.

    Through the **NVIDIA System-Assist** component, NVIDIA G-Assist queries your GPU based on the prompt, and then prints the response to the **Playground**.

    The component's output is a [`Message`](/data-types#message) containing the NVIDIA G-Assist response.
    The string response with the completed operation result is available in the `text` key in the `Message` object.
