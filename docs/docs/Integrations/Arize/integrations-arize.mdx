Arize is a tool built on [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) and [OpenInference](https://docs.arize.com/phoenix/reference/open-inference) for monitoring and optimizing LLM applications.

To enable Arize tracing, set the required Arize environment variables in your Langflow deployment.
Arize begins monitoring and collecting telemetry data from your LLM applications automatically.

:::tip
Instructions for integrating Langflow and Arize are also available in the Arize documentation:

* [Langflow tracing with Arize Platform](https://arize.com/docs/ax/integrations/frameworks-and-platforms/langflow/langflow-tracing)
* [Langflow tracing with Arize Phoenix](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/integrations/langflow/langflow-tracing)
:::

## Prerequisites

* If you are using the [standard Arize platform](https://docs.arize.com/arize), you need an **Arize Space ID** and **Arize API Key**.
* If you are using the open-source [Arize Phoenix platform](https://docs.arize.com/phoenix), you need an **Arize Phoenix API key**.

## Connect Arize to Langflow

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Arize Platform" label="Arize Platform" default>

1. In your [Arize dashboard](https://app.arize.com/), copy your **Space ID** and [**API Key (Ingestion Service Account Key)**](https://arize.com/docs/ax/security-and-settings/api-keys).

2. In the root of your Langflow application, edit your existing Langflow `.env` file or create a new one.

3. Add `ARIZE_SPACE_ID` and `ARIZE_API_KEY` environment variables:

    ```bash
    ARIZE_SPACE_ID=SPACE_ID
    ARIZE_API_KEY=API_KEY
    ```

    Replace `SPACE_ID` and `API_KEY` with the values you copied from the Arize platform.

    You do not need to specify the Arize project name if you're using the standard Arize platform.

4. Start your Langflow application with your `.env` file:

    ```bash
    uv run langflow run --env-file .env
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Arize Phoenix" label="Arize Phoenix">

1. In your [Arize Phoenix dashboard](https://app.phoenix.arize.com/), copy your **API Key**.

2. In the root of your Langflow application, edit your existing Langflow `.env` file or create a new one.

3. Add a `PHOENIX_API_KEY` environment variable:

    ```bash
    PHOENIX_API_KEY=API_KEY
    ```

    Replace `API_KEY` with the Arize Phoenix API key that you copied from the Arize Phoenix platform.

4. Start your Langflow application with your `.env` file:

    ```bash
    uv run langflow run --env-file .env
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Run a flow and view metrics in Arize

1. In Langflow, run a flow that has an **Agent** or **Language Model** component.
You must chat with the flow or trigger the LLM to produce traffic for Arize to trace.

    For example, you can create a flow from the [**Simple Agent** template](/simple-agent), add your OpenAI API key to the **Agent** component, and then click **Playground** to chat with the flow and generate traffic.

2. In Arize, open your project dashboard, and then wait for Arize to process the data.
This can take a few minutes.

3. To view metrics for your flows, go to the **LLM Tracing** tab.

    Each Langflow execution generates two traces in Arize:

    * The `AgentExecutor` trace is the Arize trace of LangChain's `AgentExecutor`.
    * The `UUID` trace is the trace of the Langflow components.

4. To view traces, go to the **Traces** tab.

    A _trace_ is the complete journey of a request, made of multiple _spans_.

5. To view spans, go to the **Spans** tab.

    A _span_ is a single operation within a trace.
    For example, a _span_ could be a single API call to OpenAI or a single function call to a custom tool.

    For information about tracing metrics in Arize, see the [Arize LLM tracing documentation](https://docs.arize.com/arize/llm-tracing/tracing).

6. To add a span to a [dataset](https://docs.arize.com/arize/llm-datasets-and-experiments/datasets-and-experiments), click **Add to Dataset**.

    All metrics on the **LLM Tracing** tab can be added to datasets.

7. To view a dataset, click the **Datasets** tab, and then select your dataset.
