Arize is a tool built on [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) and [OpenInference](https://docs.arize.com/phoenix/reference/open-inference) for monitoring and optimizing LLM applications.

To add tracing to your Langflow application, add Arize environment variables to your Langflow application.
Arize begins monitoring and collecting telemetry data from your LLM applications automatically.

## Prerequisites

* If you are using the [standard Arize platform](https://docs.arize.com/arize), you need an **Arize Space ID** and **Arize API Key**.
* If you are using the open-source [Arize Phoenix platform](https://docs.arize.com/phoenix), you need an **Arize Phoenix API key**.

## Connect Arize to Langflow

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Arize Platform" label="Arize Platform" default>

1. To retrieve your **Arize Space ID** and **Arize API Key**, navigate to the [Arize dashboard](https://app.arize.com/).
2. Click **Settings**, and then click **Space Settings and Keys**.
3. Copy the **SpaceID** and **API Key (Ingestion Service Account Key)** values.
4. Create a `.env` file in the root of your Langflow application.
5. Add the `ARIZE_SPACE_ID` and `ARIZE_API_KEY` environment variables to your Langflow application.
You do not need to specify the **Arize Project** name if you're using the standard Arize platform.
Replace the following:

* YOUR_ARIZE_SPACE_ID: the **SpaceID** value copied from Arize
* YOUR_ARIZE_API_KEY: the **API Key** value copied from Arize

```bash
ARIZE_SPACE_ID=YOUR_ARIZE_SPACE_ID
ARIZE_API_KEY=YOUR_ARIZE_API_KEY
```
6. Save the `.env` file.
7. Start your Langflow application with the values from the `.env` file.
```bash
uv run langflow run --env-file .env
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Arize Phoenix" label="Arize Phoenix">

1. To retrieve your **Arize Phoenix API key**, navigate to the [Arize dashboard](https://app.phoenix.arize.com/).
2. Click **API Key**.
3. Copy the **API Key** value.
4. Create a `.env` file in the root of your Langflow application.
5. Add the `PHOENIX_API_KEY` environment variable to your application instead.
Replace `YOUR_PHOENIX_API_KEY` with the Arize Phoenix API key that you copied from the Arize Phoenix platform.

```bash
PHOENIX_API_KEY=YOUR_PHOENIX_API_KEY
```

6. Save the `.env` file.
7. Start your Langflow application with the values from the `.env` file.
```bash
uv run langflow run --env-file .env
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Run a flow and view metrics in Arize

1. In Langflow, select the [Simple agent](/starter-projects-simple-agent) starter project.
2. In the **Agent** component's **OpenAI API Key** field, paste your **OpenAI API key**.
3. Click **Playground**.
Ask your Agent some questions to generate traffic.
4. Navigate to the [Arize dashboard](https://app.arize.com/), and then open your project.
You may have to wait a few minutes for Arize to process the data.
5. The **LLM Tracing** tab shows metrics for your flow.
Each Langflow execution generates two traces in Arize.
The `AgentExecutor` trace is the Arize trace of Langchain's `AgentExecutor`. The UUID trace is the trace of the Langflow components.
6. To view traces, click the **Traces** tab.
A **trace** is the complete journey of a request, made of multiple **spans**.
7. To view **Spans**, select the **Spans** tab.
A **span** is a single operation within a trace. For example, a **span** could be a single API call to OpenAI or a single function call to a custom tool.
For more on traces, spans, and other metrics in Arize, see the [Arize documentation](https://docs.arize.com/arize/llm-tracing/tracing).
8. All metrics in the **LLM Tracing** tab can be added to **Datasets**.
To add a span to a **Dataset**, click the **Add to Dataset** button.
9. To view a **Dataset**, click the **Datasets** tab, and then select your **Dataset**.
For more on **Datasets**, see the [Arize documentation](https://docs.arize.com/arize/llm-datasets-and-experiments/datasets-and-experiments).
