Composio components in Langflow provide [Composio](https://app.composio.dev/) tools to your **Agent** components.

Instead of juggling multiple integrations and components in your flow, connect Composio components to an **Agent** component to use all of Composio's supported APIs and actions as tools for your agent.

The following components are available in the **Composio** bundle:

* **Composio Tools**
* **GitHub**
* **Gmail**
* **Google Calendar**
* **Outlook**
* **Slack**

For information about specific Composio functionality, see the [Composio documentation](https://docs.composio.dev/introduction/intro/overview).

## Authentication for Composio components

Composio components require authentication to Composio with a Composio API key.

Depending on the components you use, you may also need additional access, such as an OpenAI API key, Gmail account, or GitHub account.

## Use Composio components in a flow

1. In the Langflow **Workspace**, add an **Agent** component.

2. In the **Workspace**, add the **Composio Tools** component.

3. Connect the **Agent** component's **Tools** port to the **Composio Tools** component's **Tools** port.

4. In the **Composio API Key** field, enter your Composio API key.

5. In the **Tool Name** field, select the tool you want your agent to have access to.

    For this example, select the **Gmail** tool to allow your agent to control an email account with the Composio tool.

6. In the **Actions** field, select the action you want the **Agent** to take with the **Gmail** tool.

    The **Gmail** tool supports multiple actions, and it also supports multiple actions within the same tool.
    For this example, select **GMAIL_CREATE_EMAIL_DRAFT**.
    For more information, see the [Composio documentation](https://docs.composio.dev/patterns/tools/use-tools/use-specific-actions).

7. Add **Chat Input** and **Chat Output** components to your flow, and then connect them to the **Agent** component's **Input** and **Response**, respectively.

8. In the **Agent** component, enter your OpenAI API key or configure the **Agent** component to use a different LLM.

9. To test the connection to Composio, click **Playground**, and then ask the LLM about the tools available to it.
The agent should provide a list of connected tools, including the **Gmail** tool and the built-in tools in the **Agent** component.

    ```text
    User:
    What tools are available to you?

    AI:
    I have access to the following tools:

    1. **GMAIL_CREATE_EMAIL_DRAFT**: This tool allows me to create a draft email using Gmail's API. I can specify the recipient's email address, subject, body content, and whether the body content is HTML.

    2. **CurrentDate-get_current_date**: This tool retrieves the current date and time in a specified timezone.
    ```

10. To test the specific tool, tell the agent to perform an action like writing a draft email:

    ```text
    Create a draft email with the subject line "Greetings from Composio"
    recipient: "your.email@address.com"
    Body content: "Hello from composio!"
    ```

    The **Playground** shows the logic the agent choose to use specific tools.
    This example response is abbreviated.

    ```text
    The draft email with the subject "Greetings from Composio" and body "Hello from composio!" has been successfully created.
    ```

    ```json
    {
      "recipient_email": "your.email@address.com",
      "subject": "Greetings from Composio",
      "body": "Hello from composio!",
      "is_html": false
    }

    {
      "data": {
        "response_data": {
          "id": "r-237981011463568567",
          "message": {
            "id": "195dd80528171132",
            "threadId": "195dd80528171132",
            "labelIds": [
              "DRAFT"
            ]
          }
        }
      },
      "error": null,
      "successfull": true,
      "successful": true
    }
    ```

11. For further confirmation, you can go to your Gmail account and find the message in your drafts folder.

12. To add more Composio actions, add more Composio components to your flow, and then connect them to the **Agent** component's **Tools** port.
