## Flow Process

1. The user inputs a meeting transcript.
2. The flow retrieves the list of Notion users and databases.
3. A prompt is generated using the transcript, user list, database list, and current date.
4. The Meeting Summarizer analyzes the transcript and identifies tasks and action items.
5. The Notion Agent uses the meeting summary to:
   - Create new pages for new tasks
   - Update existing pages for existing tasks
   - Add content to pages with meeting notes
6. The Chat Output displays a summary of actions taken in Notion.

## Run the Notion Meeting Notes flow

1. Create a flow manually or import a pre-built flow JSON file:

    * Recommended: [Download the Meeting Agent flow JSON](./Meeting_Notes_Agent.json) and then [import the flow](/concepts-flows-import) into Langflow.
    * Create a blank flow, and then add the previously described components to your flow, connecting them as shown in the flow diagram.

2. Input the Notion and OpenAI API keys in their respective components.
3. Paste your meeting transcript into the **Meeting Transcript** component.

    For optimal results, use detailed meeting transcripts. The quality of the output depends on the comprehensiveness of the input provided.

4. Run the flow by clicking <Icon name="Play" aria-hidden="True" /> **Run component** on the **Chat Output** component or open the **Playground**.
5. Review the output summarizing the actions taken in your Notion workspace.

## Customization

The flow can be customized to meet your team's specific needs.

Customize this flow by:

1. Adjusting the system prompt to change the agent's behavior or knowledge base.
2. Adding or removing Notion tools based on your specific needs.
3. Modifying the OpenAI model parameters (e.g., temperature) to adjust the agent's response style.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Ensure all API keys are correctly set and have the necessary permissions.
2. Check that your Notion integration has access to the relevant pages and databases.
3. Verify that all components are properly connected in the flow.
4. Review the Langflow logs for any error messages.
