Shall we get started?\n\nMorning, Felipe. Absolutely, let's dive in. I see we have several projects and tasks on our plate.\n\nGreat. Let's begin with the AI Content Gen project. I'm currently working on \"Montar base agente seletor de cortes.\" It's in progress, and I'm aiming to complete it by June 14th. Have you had a chance to look at this task, Cezar?\n\nI haven't been directly involved with that one. Can you give me an overview of what it entails?\n\nOf course. Essentially, we're building a base agent that can intelligently select and edit content. It's part of our larger AI-driven content generation initiative. The challenge is creating an algorithm that can understand context and make smart editing decisions.\n\nInteresting. How's the progress so far?\n\nIt's coming along. I've set up the basic framework, but fine-tuning the selection criteria is proving to be more complex than initially anticipated. I might need an extra day or two beyond the June 14th deadline.\n\nUnderstood, Felipe. Keep me posted if you need any resources or if the deadline needs to be adjusted. By the way, I've been meaning to ask - have you had a chance to look into that new NLP library I mentioned last week? I think it could be useful for this project.\n\nActually, Cezar, I haven't gotten to that yet. Should we add it as a new task? Maybe \"Evaluate NLP library for content selection\"?\n\nGood idea. Let's add that to our task list with a due date of next Friday. Now, moving on to the next task in this project - \"Create Notion Task Automation.\" It's assigned to you and set for June 19th, but you haven't started it yet, right? This is where I'd like to focus our discussion today.\n\nThat's correct. So, the goal is to streamline our workflow by automating certain tasks within Notion. I'm thinking we could create scripts or use Notion's API to automatically create, assign, and update tasks based on certain triggers or schedules.\n\nThat sounds like it could save us a lot of time. What specific automations are you considering?\n\nI'm glad you asked, Cezar. I'm thinking of a few key areas:\n1. Automatic task creation based on project milestones\n2. Assigning tasks to team members based on their expertise and current workload\n3. Updating task statuses based on linked database entries\n4. Generating weekly progress reports\n5. Setting up reminders for overdue tasks\n\nThose all sound valuable. Have you looked into the technical requirements for implementing these?\n\nI've done some initial research. Notion's API seems robust enough to handle these automations. We'll likely need to use a combination of Notion's API and a server to run our scripts. I'm thinking of using Node.js for this.\n\nGood thinking. Do you foresee any challenges?\n\nThe main challenge will be ensuring our automations are flexible enough to handle different project structures and team dynamics. We'll need to build in some configurability.\n\nAgreed. Let's make sure we involve the team in defining these automations. Their input will be crucial for making this truly useful. Oh, and speaking of team input, I think we should add a task for \"Conduct team survey on Notion pain points.\" This could help us prioritize which automations to tackle first.\n\nThat's an excellent idea, Cezar. I'll create that task and aim to complete the survey by next Wednesday. Now, I see we have another Notion-related task: \"Subir Notion Agent no Langflow Prod.\" Can you remind me what this entails?\n\nYes, this task is about deploying our Notion integration agent to the Langflow production environment. It's not started yet, but it's a crucial step in making our Notion automations available to the whole team.\n\nI see. What's the timeline for this?\n\nWe haven't set a specific deadline yet, but I think we should aim to complete this shortly after the automation task. Let's tentatively say by the end of June?\n\nSounds reasonable. Make sure to coordinate with the DevOps team for a smooth deployment. And while we're on the topic of deployment, we should probably add a task for \"Create documentation for Notion Agent usage.\" We want to make sure the team knows how to use these new tools once they're available.\n\nYou're right, Felipe. I'll add that to our task list. Now, switching gears a bit, let's talk about the Internal Projects. I see you're working on \"Crypto Links\" - it's in progress.\n\nAh yes, our blockchain initiative. It's moving forward. I'm researching various blockchain platforms and their potential applications for our projects. I'm particularly interested in smart contract capabilities.\n\nInteresting. Keep me updated on any promising findings. By the way, have you considered reaching out to any blockchain experts for consultation? It might be worth adding a task for \"Schedule blockchain expert consultation.\"\n\nThat's a great suggestion, Cezar. I'll add it to my to-do list. Now, for the Internal Tasks, I see you're assigned to \"Revisar modos do Charlinho, preparar para open source.\" What's the status on that?\n\nI haven't started yet, but it's on my radar. The deadline is June 7th, so I'll be diving into it this week. Essentially, we need to review and refine Charlinho's modes before we open-source the project.\n\nSounds good. Let me know if you need any assistance with that. Oh, and don't forget we need to add a task for \"Prepare Charlinho documentation for open source.\" We want to make sure our project is well-documented when we release it.\n\nYou're right, Felipe. I'll make sure to include that in our task list. Now, I see you have several tasks assigned to you in the Internal Tasks section. Can you give me a quick rundown?\n\nOf course. I'm working on finding a freelancer to create flows in ComfyUI - that's in progress and due May 28th. I'm also handling the conception of the Agent UI, due May 30th. Both are moving along well.\n\nThere's also a task to \"Check, install and test Gladia to use a bot in Google Meet.\" That's in progress, and I'm collaborating with C on it.\n\nThat's quite a workload. How are you managing all these tasks?\n\nIt's challenging, but I'm prioritizing based on deadlines and dependencies. The Notion automation project is a high priority because it'll help us manage tasks more efficiently in the long run.\n\nGood strategy, Felipe. Is there anything you need from me or the team to help move these tasks forward?\n\nActually, yes. For the \"pegar os arquivos necessários para tentarmos montar um stinger com ffmpeg\" task, I could use some input on which files are critical for this. It's a low-priority task due June 2nd, but any insights would be helpful.\n\nI'll review our asset library and send you a list of potential files by tomorrow. Oh, and let's add a task for \"Create ffmpeg stinger tutorial\" once we figure out the process. It could be useful for the team in the future.\n\nGreat idea, Cezar. I'll add that to our backlog. Anything else we should discuss?\n\nI think we've covered the major points. Oh, one last thing - for the \"Create Notion Task Automation\" project, I was thinking of setting up a series of short daily meetings next week to keep everyone aligned. What do you think?\n\nThat's a good idea. Maybe 15-minute stand-ups? We can use those to address any roadblocks quickly. And let's add a task for \"Set up Notion Automation progress tracking board\" to help visualize our progress during these stand-ups.\n\nPerfect. I'll send out calendar invites this afternoon and create that tracking board task. Any final thoughts or concerns, Cezar?\n\nNot from my side. I think we have a clear path forward, especially with the Notion-related tasks and the new items we've added to our list.\n\nAgreed. Let's plan to reconvene next week to check on progress, particularly for the Notion automation project and these new tasks we've discussed. Thanks for the comprehensive update, Felipe.\n\nThank you, Cezar. I'll send out a summary of our discussion and action items shortly, including all the new tasks we've identified during this meeting.\n",

Your goal is to extract relevant tasks from the given transcript, search for related existing tasks in Notion, and provide a comprehensive list of tasks with their current status and any needed updates.\n\nYou have access to the following input:\n\n<transcript>\n{TRANSCRIPT}\n</transcript>\n\n<users>\n{USERS}\n</users>\n\nFollow these steps to complete your task:\n\n1. Carefully read through the transcript and identify any mentioned tasks, action items, or follow-ups.\n\n2. For each identified task:\n   a. Use the notion_search tool to find if there's an existing related task in Notion.\n   b. If a related task is found, note its ID and current status.\n   c. If no related task is found, mark it as a new task.\n\n3. For each task (existing or new), determine:\n   a. The task name or description\n   b. The assigned person (if mentioned)\n   c. The current status (for existing tasks) or suggested status (for new tasks)\n   d. Any updates or changes mentioned in the transcript\n\n4. Compile your findings into a list of tasks using the following format:\n\n<task_list>\n<task>\n<id>[Notion page ID if existing, or \"NEW\" if new task]</id>\n<name>[Task name or description]</name>\n<assignee>[Assigned person, if mentioned]</assignee>\n<status>[Current status for existing tasks, or suggested status for new tasks]</status>\n<updates>[Any updates or changes mentioned in the transcript]</updates>\n</task>\n</task_list>\n\nRemember to focus on tasks that are directly related to the meeting discussion. Do not include general conversation topics or unrelated mentions as tasks.\n\nProvide your final output in the format specified above, with each task enclosed in its own <task></task> tags within the overall <task_list></task_list> structure.\n\nToday is: {CURRENT_DATE}\n</Instructions>\n\n\n",

Your goal is to create new tasks and update existing ones using the Notion API tools available to you, and then provide a summary in a simple markdown format suitable for a chat interface.\n\nYou have access to the following inputs:\n\n<task_list>\n{TASK_LIST}\n</task_list>\n\n<databases>\n{DATABASES}\n</databases>\n\n<users>\n{USERS}\n</users>\n\nFollow these steps to update the tasks in Notion and generate a markdown summary:\n\n1. Identify the Task database ID from the provided <databases> list.\n\n2. Before processing any tasks, retrieve the database properties for the Task database:\n   a. Use the notion_database_properties and carefully review the properties, their types, and any options for select or multi-select properties.\n   b. Pay attention to the properties format for further usage.\n\n3. For each task in the task list:\n   a. If the task ID is \"NEW\", create a new task using the create_notion_page tool.\n   b. If the task has an existing ID, update the task using the update_notion_page tool.\n   c. Remember to use the properties from the DB retrieved from the notion_database_properties tool\n\n4. When creating a new task:\n   a. Use the create_notion_page tool.\n   b. Include the task name, assignee (if available), status, and any other relevant properties based on the database structure.\n   c. Ensure that the property names and types match exactly with what you retrieved from the notion_database_properties call.\n\n5. When updating an existing task:\n   a. Use the update_notion_page tool.\n   b. Update the status, assignee, or any other relevant properties mentioned in the <updates> field.\n   c. Ensure that the property names and types match exactly with what you retrieved from the notion_database_properties call.\n\n6. After each function call, wait for the <function_result> before proceeding to the next task.\n\n7. If you encounter any errors during the process, note them and continue with the next task.\n\n8. Provide a summary of your actions for each task in a simple markdown format. Use the following structure:\n   # Task Update Summary\n\n   ## Created Tasks\n   - **[Task Name]**: Assigned to [Assignee], Status: [Status]\n     - Details: [Brief description of the new task]\n\n   ## Updated Tasks\n   - **[Task Name]** (ID: [Notion Page ID])\n     - Changes: [Brief description of changes]\n     - Status: [Success/Error]\n\n   ## Errors\n   - **[Task Name or ID]**: [Description of the error encountered]\n\n\nRemember to use the exact property names, types, and options as specified in the Notion database properties you retrieved at the beginning. This is crucial for ensuring that all updates and creations are done correctly.\n\nIf you encounter any errors or uncertainties, include them in the Errors section of the markdown summary. With enough detail to the user understand the issues.\n\nProvide your final output as a complete markdown document containing all the tasks you've processed, whether they were created, updated, or encountered errors. Use only basic markdown formatting (headers, bold, lists) to ensure compatibility with chat interfaces. Do not include any XML tags or complex formatting in your final output.\n\nToday is: {CURRENT_DATE}\n\n</Instructions>",
