Unlock trustworthy Agentic, RAG, and LLM pipelines with Cleanlab's evaluation and remediation suite.

[Cleanlab](https://www.cleanlab.ai/) adds automation and trust to every data point going in and every prediction coming out of AI and RAG solutions.

This Langflow integration provides three Langflow components that assess and improve the trustworthiness of any LLM or RAG pipeline output.

Use the components in this bundle to quantify the trustworthiness of any LLM response with a score between `0` and `1`, and explain why a response may be good or bad. For RAG/Agentic pipelines with context, you can evaluate context sufficiency, groundedness, helpfulness, and query clarity with quantitative scores. Additionally, you can remediate low-trust responses with warnings or fallback answers.

## Prerequisites

- [A Cleanlab API key](https://tlm.cleanlab.ai/)

## CleanlabEvaluator

This component evaluates and explains the trustworthiness of a prompt and response pair using Cleanlab. For more information on how the score works, see the [Cleanlab documentation](https://help.cleanlab.ai/tlm/).

## Cleanlab component example flows

The following example flows show how to use the **CleanlabEvaluator** and **CleanlabRemediator** components to evaluate and remediate responses from any LLM, and how to use the `CleanlabRAGEvaluator` component to evaluate RAG pipeline outputs.

### Evaluate and remediate responses from an LLM

:::tip
Optionally, 
<DownloadableJsonFile
  source="./eval_and_remediate_cleanlab.json"
  title="Download"
/>  the Evaluate and Remediate flow.
:::

This flow evaluates and remediates the trustworthiness of a response from any LLM using the **CleanlabEvaluator** and **CleanlabRemediator** components.

![Evaluate response trustworthiness](./eval_response.png)

Connect the `Message` output from any LLM component to the `response` input of the **CleanlabEvaluator** component, and then connect the Prompt component to its `prompt` input.

The **CleanlabEvaluator** component returns a trust score and explanation from the flow.

The **CleanlabRemediator** component uses this trust score to determine whether to output the original response, warn about it, or replace it with a fallback answer.

This example shows a response that was determined to be untrustworthy (a score of `.09`) and flagged with a warning by the **CleanlabRemediator** component.

![CleanlabRemediator Example](./cleanlab_remediator_example.png)

To hide untrustworthy responses, configure the **CleanlabRemediator** component to replace the response with a fallback message.

![CleanlabRemediator Example](./cleanlab_remediator_example_fallback.png)

### Evaluate RAG pipeline

This example flow includes the [Vector Store RAG](/starter-projects-vector-store-rag) template with the **CleanlabRAGEvaluator** component added to evaluate the flow's context, query, and response.

To use the **CleanlabRAGEvaluator** component in a flow, connect the `context`, `query`, and `response` outputs from any RAG pipeline to the **CleanlabRAGEvaluator** component.

![Evaluate RAG pipeline](./eval_rag.png)

Here is an example of the `Evaluation Summary` output from the **CleanlabRAGEvaluator** component.

![Evaluate RAG pipeline](./eval_summary_rag.png)

The `Evaluation Summary` includes the query, context, response, and all evaluation results. In this example, the `Context Sufficiency` and `Response Groundedness` scores are low (a score of `0.002`) because the context doesn't contain information about the query, and the response is not grounded in the context.
