Langflow integrates with the [Google Vertex AI API](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/aiplatform.googleapis.com) for authenticating the [Vertex AI embeddings model](/components-embedding-models#vertexai-embeddings) and [Vertex AI](/components-models#vertexai) components.

Learn how to create a service account JSON in Google Cloud to authenticate Langflowâ€™s Vertex AI components.

## Create a service account with Vertex AI access

1. Select and enable your Google Cloud project.
For more information, see [Create a Google Cloud project](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project).
2. Create a service account in your Google Cloud project.
For more information, see [Create a service account](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#service-account).
3. Assign the **Vertex AI Service Agent** role to your new account.
This role allows Langflow to access Vertex AI resources.
For more information, see [Vertex AI access control with IAM](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/general/access-control).
4. To generate a new JSON key for the service account, navigate to your service account.
5. Click **Add Key**, and then click **Create new key**.
6. Under **Key type**, select **JSON**, and then click **Create**.
A JSON private key file is downloaded.
Now that you have a service account and a JSON private key, you need to configure the credentials in Langflow components.

## Configure credentials in Langflow components

With your service account configured and your credentials JSON file created, follow these steps to authenticate the Langflow application.

1. Create a new project in Langflow.
2. From the components sidebar, drag and drop either the **Vertex AI** or **Vertex AI Embeddings** component to your workspace.
3. In the Vertex AI component's **Credentials** field, add the service account JSON file.
4. Confirm the component can access the Vertex AI resources.
Connect a **Chat input** and **Chat output** component to the Vertex AI component.
A successful chat confirms the component has access to the Vertex AI resources.
