[LangWatch](https://app.langwatch.ai/) is an all-in-one LLMOps platform for monitoring, observability, analytics, evaluations and alerting for getting user insights and improve your LLM workflows.

## Integrate LangWatch observability

To integrate with Langflow, add your LangWatch API key as a Langflow environment variable:

1. Get a LangWatch API key from your LangWatch account.

2. Add the key to your Langflow `.env` file:

    ```shell
    LANGWATCH_API_KEY="API_KEY_STRING"
    ```

    Alternatively, you can set the environment variable in your terminal session:

    ```shell
    export LANGWATCH_API_KEY="API_KEY_STRING"
    ```

3. Restart Langflow with your `.env` file, if you modified the Langflow `.env`:

    ```
    langflow run --env-file .env
    ```

4. Run a flow.

5. View the LangWatch dashboard for monitoring and observability.

## Use the LangWatch Evaluator

In your flows, you can use the **LangWatch Evaluator** component to use LangWatch's evaluation endpoints to assess a model's performance.

This component is available in the LangWatch bundle in the **Components** menu.
