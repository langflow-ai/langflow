Use the [MCP Tools component](/mcp-client) to connect Langflow to a [Datastax Astra DB MCP server](https://github.com/datastax/astra-db-mcp).

1. Install an LTS release of [Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

2. Create an [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) API key.

3. Create an [Astra DB Serverless (Vector) database](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-db-serverless/databases/create-database.html#create-vector-database), if you don't already have one.

4. Get your database's Astra DB API endpoint and an Astra application token with the **Database Administrator** role. For more information, see [Generate an application token for a database](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-db-serverless/administration/manage-application-tokens.html#database-token).

5. To follow along with this guide, create a flow based on the [**Simple Agent** template](/simple-agent).

    You can also use an existing flow or create a blank flow.

6. Remove the **URL** tool, and then replace it with an [**MCP Tools** component](/mcp-client).

7. Configure the **MCP Tools** component as follows:

    1. Select **Stdio** mode.
    2. In the **MCP server** field, add the following code to connect to an Astra DB MCP server:

        ```bash
        npx -y @datastax/astra-db-mcp
        ```

    3. In the **Env** fields, add variables for `ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN` and `ASTRA_DB_API_ENDPOINT` with the values from your Astra database.

        :::important
        Environment variables declared in your Langflow `.env` file can be referenced in your MCP server commands, but you cannot reference global variables declared in Langflow.

        If you want to use variables for `ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN` and `ASTRA_DB_API_ENDPOINT`, add them to Langflow's `.env` file, and then restart Langflow.
        For more information, see [global variables](/configuration-global-variables).
        :::

        Add each variable separately.
        To add another variable field click <Icon name="Plus" aria-hidden="true"/> **Add More**.

        ```bash
        ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN=AstraCS:...
        ```

        ```bash
        ASTRA_DB_API_ENDPOINT=https://...-us-east-2.apps.astra.datastax.com
        ```

10. In the **Agent** component, add your **OpenAI API key**.

    The default model is an OpenAI model.
    If you want to use a different model, edit the **Model Provider**, **Model Name**, and **API Key** fields accordingly.

11. Open the **Playground**, and then ask the agent, `What collections are available?`

    Since Langflow is connected to your Astra DB database through the MCP server, the agent chooses the correct tool and connects to your database to retrieve the answer.
    For example:

    ```text
    The available collections in your database are:
    collection_002
    hardware_requirements
    load_collection
    nvidia_collection
    software_requirements
    ```
