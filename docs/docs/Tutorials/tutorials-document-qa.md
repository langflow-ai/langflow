---

- [Langflow installed and running](/get-started-installation)

This flow is composed of a standard chatbot with the **Chat Input**, **Prompt**, **OpenAI**, and **Chat Output** components, but it also incorporates a **File** component, which loads a file from your local machine. **Parse Data** is used to convert the data from **File** into the **Prompt** component as `{Document}`. The **Prompt** component is instructed to answer questions based on the contents of `{Document}`. This gives the **OpenAI** component context it would not otherwise have access to.


### Run the document QA flow {#f58fcc2b9e594156a829b1772b6a7191}


1. To select a document to load, in the **File** component, click the **Path** field. Select a local file, and then click **Open**. The file name appears in the field.

2. Click the **Playground** button. Here you can chat with the AI that has access to your document's content.


3. Type in a question about the document content and press Enter. You should see a contextual response.
