Langflow provides flexible memory management options for storage and retrieval of data relevant to your flows and your Langflow server.
This includes essential Langflow database tables, file management, and caching, as well as chat memory.

Langflow supports both local memory and external memory options.

## Local Langflow database tables

The default storage option in Langflow is a [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) database stored in your system's cache directory:

- **macOS Desktop**: `/Users/<username>/.langflow/data/database.db`
- **Windows Desktop**: `C:\Users\<name>\AppData\Roaming\com.Langflow\data\langflow.db`
- **OSS macOS/Windows/Linux/WSL (uv pip install)**: `<path_to_venv>/lib/python3.12/site-packages/langflow/langflow.db` (Python version may vary)
- **OSS macOS/Windows/Linux/WSL (git clone)**: `<path_to_clone>/src/backend/base/langflow/langflow.db`

The following tables are stored in `langflow.db`:

• **User** - Stores user account information including credentials, permissions, and profiles. For more information, see [Authentication](/configuration-authentication).

• **Flow** - Contains flow configurations. For more information, see [Build flows](/concepts-flows).

• **Message** - Stores chat messages and interactions that occur between components. For more information, see [Message objects](/data-types#message).

• **Transaction** - Records execution history and results of flow runs. This information is used for [logging](/logging).

• **ApiKey** - Manages API authentication keys for users. For more information, see [API keys](/configuration-api-keys).

• **Project** - Provides a structure for flow storage. For more information, see [Projects](/concepts-flows#projects).

• **Variables** - Stores global encrypted values and credentials. For more information, see [Global variables](/configuration-global-variables).

• **VertexBuild** - Tracks the build status of individual nodes within flows. For more information, see [Run a flow in the Playground](/concepts-playground).

For more information, see the database models in the [source code](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow/tree/main/src/backend/base/langflow/services/database/models).

## Store messages in local memory

To store and retrieve messages in local Langflow memory, add a [Message history](/components-helpers#message-history) component to your flow.

To store or retrieve chat messages from external memory, connect the **External memory** port of the **Message history** component to a **Memory** component.
An example flow looks like this:

If external storage is connected to a memory helper component, no chat messages are stored in local Langflow memory.

For an example of using local chat memory, see the [Memory chatbot](/memory-chatbot) starter flow.

## Configure external memory

To replace the default Langflow SQLite database with another database, modify the `LANGFLOW_DATABASE_URL` and start Langflow with this value.

```
LANGFLOW_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/langflow
```

For an example, see [Configure an external PostgreSQL database](/configuration-custom-database).

## Configure the external database connection

The following settings allow you to fine-tune your database connection pool and timeout settings:

```
LANGFLOW_DB_CONNECTION_SETTINGS='{"pool_size": 20, "max_overflow": 30, "pool_timeout": 30, "pool_pre_ping": true, "pool_recycle": 1800, "echo": false}'
LANGFLOW_DB_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=20
```

- `pool_size`: Maximum number of database connections to keep in the pool (default: 20)
- `max_overflow`: Maximum number of connections that can be created beyond the pool_size (default: 30)
- `pool_timeout`: Number of seconds to wait before timing out on getting a connection from the pool (default: 30)
- `pool_pre_ping`: If true, the pool tests connections for liveness upon each checkout (default: true)
- `pool_recycle`: Number of seconds after which a connection is automatically recycled (default: 1800, or 30 minutes)
- `echo`: If true, SQL queries are logged for debugging purposes (default: false)
- `LANGFLOW_DB_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`: Maximum number of seconds to wait when establishing a new database connection (default: 20)

## Configure cache memory

The default Langflow caching behavior is an asynchronous, in-memory cache.
```
LANGFLOW_LANGCHAIN_CACHE=InMemoryCache
LANGFLOW_CACHE_TYPE=Async
```

Alternative caching options can be configured, but options other than the default asynchronous, in-memory cache are not supported.
The default behavior is suitable for most use cases.
