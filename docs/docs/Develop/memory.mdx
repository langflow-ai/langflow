Langflow provides flexible memory management options for storage and retrieval of data relevant to your flows and your Langflow server.
This includes essential Langflow database tables, file management, and caching, as well as chat memory.

## Storage options and paths

Langflow supports both local memory and external memory options.

Langflow's default storage option is a [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) database stored in your system's cache directory.
The default storage path depends on your operation system and installation method:

- **macOS Desktop**: `/Users/<username>/.langflow/data/database.db`
- **Windows Desktop**: `C:\Users\<name>\AppData\Roaming\com.Langflow\data\langflow.db`
- **OSS macOS/Windows/Linux/WSL (`uv pip install`)**: `<path_to_venv>/lib/python3.12/site-packages/langflow/langflow.db` (Python version may vary)
- **OSS macOS/Windows/Linux/WSL (`git clone`)**: `<path_to_clone>/src/backend/base/langflow/langflow.db`

Alternatively, you can use an external PostgreSQL database for all of your Langflow storage.
You can also selectively use external storage for chat memory, separate from other Langflow storage.
For more information, see [Configure external memory](#configure-external-memory) and [Store chat memory](#store-chat-memory).

## Local Langflow database tables

The following tables are stored in `langflow.db`:

• **User**: Stores user account information including credentials, permissions, and profiles. For more information, see [Authentication](/configuration-authentication).

• **Flow**: Contains flow configurations. For more information, see [Build flows](/concepts-flows).

• **Message**: Stores chat messages and interactions that occur between components. For more information, see [Message objects](/data-types#message).

• **Transaction**: Records execution history and results of flow runs. This information is used for [logging](/logging).

• **ApiKey**: Manages API authentication keys for users. For more information, see [API keys](/configuration-api-keys).

• **Project**: Provides a structure for flow storage. For more information, see [Projects](/concepts-flows#projects).

• **Variables**: Stores global encrypted values and credentials. For more information, see [Global variables](/configuration-global-variables).

• **VertexBuild**: Tracks the build status of individual nodes within flows. For more information, see [Run a flow in the Playground](/concepts-playground).

For more information, see the database models in the [source code](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow/tree/main/src/backend/base/langflow/services/database/models).

## Configure external memory

To replace the default Langflow SQLite database with another database, modify the `LANGFLOW_DATABASE_URL` environment variable, and then start Langflow with your `.env` file:

```
LANGFLOW_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/langflow
```

For an example, see [Configure an external PostgreSQL database](/configuration-custom-database).

### Configure the external database connection

The following settings allow you to fine-tune your database connection pool and timeout settings:

```
LANGFLOW_DB_CONNECTION_SETTINGS='{"pool_size": 20, "max_overflow": 30, "pool_timeout": 30, "pool_pre_ping": true, "pool_recycle": 1800, "echo": false}'
LANGFLOW_DB_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=20
```

- `pool_size`: Maximum number of database connections to keep in the pool (default: 20)
- `max_overflow`: Maximum number of connections that can be created beyond the pool_size (default: 30)
- `pool_timeout`: Number of seconds to wait before timing out on getting a connection from the pool (default: 30)
- `pool_pre_ping`: If true, the pool tests connections for liveness upon each checkout (default: true)
- `pool_recycle`: Number of seconds after which a connection is automatically recycled (default: 1800, or 30 minutes)
- `echo`: If true, SQL queries are logged for debugging purposes (default: false)
- `LANGFLOW_DB_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`: Maximum number of seconds to wait when establishing a new database connection (default: 20)

## Configure cache memory

The default Langflow caching behavior is an asynchronous, in-memory cache.
```
LANGFLOW_LANGCHAIN_CACHE=InMemoryCache
LANGFLOW_CACHE_TYPE=Async
```

Alternative caching options can be configured, but options other than the default asynchronous, in-memory cache are not supported.
The default behavior is suitable for most use cases.

## Store chat memory

Chat-based flows with a **Language Model** or **Agent** component have built-in chat memory that is enabled by default.
This memory allows them to retrieve and reference messages from previous conversations, maintaining a rolling context window for each chat session ID.

<details>
<summary>How does chat memory work?</summary>

Chat memory is a cache for the LLM or agent to preserve past conversations to retain and reference that context in future interactions.
For example, if a user has already told the LLM their name, the LLM can retrieve that information from chat memory rather than asking the user to repeat themselves in future conversations or messages.

Chat memory is distinct from vector store memory because it is built specifically for storing and retrieving chat messages from databases.

Components that support chat memory (such as the **Agent**, **Language Model**, **Message History**, or third-party **Chat Memory** components) provide access to their respective databases _as memory_.
Retrieval as memory is an important distinction for LLMs and agents because this storage and retrieval mechanism is specifically designed to recall context from past conversations.
Unlike vector stores, which are designed for semantic search and retrieval of text chunks, chat memory is designed to store and retrieve chat messages in a way that is optimized for conversation history.

### Session ID and chat memory

Chat memory is grouped by [session ID (`session_id`)](/session-id).

The default session ID is the flow ID, which means that all chat messages for a flow are stored under the same session ID as one large chat session.

For better segregation of chat memory, especially in flows used by multiple users, consider using custom session IDs.
For example, if you use user IDs as session IDs, then each user's chat history is stored separately, isolating the context of their chats from other users' chats.

### Chat memory options

Where and how chat memory is stored depends on the components used in your flow:

* **Language Model component**: All messages are stored in [Langflow storage](#storage-options-and-paths) with no additional memory configuration options.
For more control over chat memory, use an **Agent** or **Message History** component.

* **Agent component**: Uses Langflow storage for chat memory with limited memory configuration options, such as **Number of Chat History Messages**.
For more control over chat memory, use a **Message History** component along with the **Agent** component.

* **Agent/Language Model and Message History components**: Uses Langflow storage for chat memory with more options for sorting, filtering, and limiting memories provided by the **Message History** component.

* **Agent/Language Model, Message History, and third-party Chat Memory components**: Provides the most control over your chat memory configuration by using external storage for chat memory, in addition to configuration options provided by both the **Message History** and the third-party **Chat Memory** components.

    This option is recommended if you want to completely separate chat memory from your other Langflow storage.

    If your flow uses external storage for chat memory, then no chat messages are stored in local Langflow storage.

For more information and examples, see [**Message History** component](/components-helpers#message-history), [Agent memory](/agents#agent-memory), and the [**Memory chatbot** template](/memory-chatbot).
