This section provides information for developing and configuring Langflow applications.

The [Build Applications](/build-application) guide walks you through packaging and serving a flow, from your local development environment to a containerized application.
As you build your application, you will configure the following application behaviors. More detailed explanation is provided in the individual pages.

• [Memory and Storage](/memory) - Configure Langflow's storage and caching behavior.

• [Session Management](/session-id) - Use session ID to manage communication between components.

• [Logging](/logging) - Monitor and debug your Langflow applications.

• [Custom Dependencies](/install-custom-dependencies) - Add and manage additional Python packages and external dependencies in your Langflow projects.
