This page provides information about Langflow logs, including logs for individual flows and the Langflow application itself.

Langflow uses the `loguru` library for logging.

The default logfile is named `langflow.log`.
Langflow also produces logfiles for flows.

## Log storage

The default logfile storage location depends on your operating system:

- **macOS Desktop**:`/Users/<username>/.langflow/cache`
- **Windows Desktop**:`C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\com.Langflow\cache`
- **OSS macOS/Windows/Linux/WSL (`uv pip install`)**: `<path_to_venv>/lib/python3.12/site-packages/langflow/cache`
- **OSS macOS/Windows/Linux/WSL (`git clone`)**: `<path_to_clone>/src/backend/base/langflow/cache`

To customize log storage, see [Configure log options](#configure-log-options).

## Configure log options

Use [Langflow environment variables](/environment-variables) to configure logging options in your Langflow `.env` file, and then start Langflow with `uv run langflow run --env-file .env`.

The following environment variables are available to configure logging:

### Logging environment variables

| Variable | Format | Default | Description |
|----------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `LANGFLOW_LOG_LEVEL` | String | `ERROR` | Sets the log level as one of `DEBUG`, `ERROR`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, and `CRITICAL`. For example, `LANGFLOW_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`. |
| `LANGFLOW_LOG_FILE` | String | Not set | Sets the log file storage location if you want to use a non-default location. For example, `LANGFLOW_LOG_FILE=path/to/logfile.log`. If this option isn't set, logs are written to stdout. |
| `LANGFLOW_LOG_ENV` | String | `default` | Controls how logs are formatted and displayed. `container`: JSON format for Docker/structured logging. `container_csv`: CSV format for data analysis. `default` or unset: Pretty, colorful format for development/reading using [RichHandler](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/logging.html). |
| `LANGFLOW_LOG_ROTATION` | String | `1 day` | Controls when the log file is rotated, either based on time or file size. Time-based rotation: "1 day", "12 hours", "1 week". Size-based rotation: "10 MB", "1 GB". Disable rotation: "None" (log files will grow without limit). |
| `LANGFLOW_LOG_RETRIEVER_BUFFER_SIZE` | Integer | `10000` | Set the buffer size for log retrieval. Only used if `LANGFLOW_ENABLE_LOG_RETRIEVAL` is enabled. |
| `LANGFLOW_LOG_FORMAT` | String | Not set | Set the log format configuration. |
| `LANGFLOW_PRETTY_LOGS` | Boolean | True | Enable pretty log formatting with colors and rich console output. |

A complete example `.env` file is available in the [Langflow repository](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow/blob/main/.env.example).

## Flow and component logs

After you run a flow, you can inspect the logs for the each component and flow run.
For example, you can inspect `Message` objects ingested and generated by [**Input and Output** components](/components-io).

### View flow logs

In the visual editor, click **Logs** to view logs for the entire flow:

![Logs pane](/img/logs.png)

Then, click the cells in the **inputs** and **outputs** columns to inspect the `Message` objects.
For example, the following `Message` data could be the output from a **Chat Input** component:

```text
    "messages": [
    {
        "message": "What's the recommended way to install Docker on Mac M1?",
        "sender": "User",
        "sender_name": "User",
        "session_id": "Session Apr 21, 17:37:04",
        "stream_url": null,
        "component_id": "ChatInput-4WKag",
        "files": [],
        "type": "text"
    }
    ],
```

In the case of Input/Output components, the original input might not be structured as a `Message` object.
For example, a **Language Model** component might pass a raw text response to a **Chat Output** component that is then transformed into a `Message` object.

You can find `.log` files for flows at your Langflow installation's log storage location.
For filepaths, see [Log storage](#log-storage).

### View chat logs

In the **Playground**, you can inspect the chat history for each chat session.
For more information, see [View chat history](/concepts-playground#view-chat-history).

### View output from a single component

When debugging issues with the format or content of a flow's output, it can help to inspect each component's output to determine where data is being lost or malformed.

To view the output produced by a single component during the most recent run, click <Icon name="TextSearch" aria-hidden="true"/> **Inspect output** on the component in the visual editor.

## Access Langflow Desktop logs {#desktop-logs}

If you encounter issues with Langflow Desktop, you might need to access startup logs for debugging.
Follow the steps for your operating system.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">

1. Open Terminal and run:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Library/Logs/com.Langflow
   ```

2. To open the folder and view the log files, run the command:
   ```bash
   open .
   ```

3. Locate the `langflow.log` file.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

1. Open the Command Prompt (CMD), and then run the following command:
   ```cmd
   cd %LOCALAPPDATA%\com.langflow\logs
   ```

2. To open the folder and view the log files, run the command:
   ```cmd
   start .
   ```

3. Locate the `langflow.log` file.
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can use the log file to investigate the issue on your own, add context to a [GitHub Issue](/contributing-github-issues), or send it to [support](/luna-for-langflow) for debugging assistance.

The log file is only created when Langflow Desktop runs. If you don't see a log file, try starting Langflow Desktop first, then check for the log file.
