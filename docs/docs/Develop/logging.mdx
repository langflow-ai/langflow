This page provides information about Langflow logs, including logs for individual flows and the Langflow application itself.

Langflow uses the `loguru` library for logging.

The default logfile is named `langflow.log`.
Langflow also produces logfiles for flows.

## Log storage

The default logfile storage location depends on your operating system:

- **macOS Desktop**:`/Users/<username>/.langflow/cache`
- **Windows Desktop**:`C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\com.Langflow\cache`
- **OSS macOS/Windows/Linux/WSL (`uv pip install`)**: `<path_to_venv>/lib/python3.12/site-packages/langflow/cache`
- **OSS macOS/Windows/Linux/WSL (`git clone`)**: `<path_to_clone>/src/backend/base/langflow/cache`

To customize log storage, see [Configure log options](#configure-log-options).

## Configure log options

Use [Langflow environment variables](/environment-variables) to configure logging options in your Langflow `.env` file, and then start Langflow with `uv run langflow run --env-file .env`.

The following environment variables are available to configure logging:

* `LANGFLOW_LOG_LEVEL`: Sets the log level as one of `DEBUG`, `ERROR` (default), `INFO`, `WARNING`, and `CRITICAL`. For example, `LANGFLOW_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`.

* `LANGFLOW_LOG_FILE`: Sets the log file storage location if you want to use a non-default location.
For example, `LANGFLOW_LOG_FILE=path/to/logfile.log`.

* `LANGFLOW_LOG_ENV`: Controls log output and formatting.

    * `LANGFLOW_LOG_ENV=container`: Outputs serialized JSON to stdout.
    * `LANGFLOW_LOG_ENV=container_csv`: Outputs CSV-formatted plain text to stdout.
    * `LANGFLOW_LOG_ENV=default` or unset: Outputs prettified output with [RichHandler](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/logging.html).

A complete example `.env` file is available in the [Langflow repository](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow/blob/main/.env.example).

## Flow and component logs

After you run a flow, you can inspect the logs for the each component and flow run.
For example, you can inspect `Message` objects ingested and generated by [input and output components](/components-io).

### View flow logs

In the visual editor, click **Logs** to view logs for the entire flow:

![Logs pane](/img/logs.png)

Then, click the cells in the **inputs** and **outputs** columns to inspect the `Message` objects.
For example, the following `Message` data could be the output from a **Chat Input** component:

```text
    "messages": [
    {
        "message": "What's the recommended way to install Docker on Mac M1?",
        "sender": "User",
        "sender_name": "User",
        "session_id": "Session Apr 21, 17:37:04",
        "stream_url": null,
        "component_id": "ChatInput-4WKag",
        "files": [],
        "type": "text"
    }
    ],
```

In the case of Input/Output components, the original input might not be structured as a `Message` object.
For example, a **Language Model** component might pass a raw text response to a **Chat Output** component that is then transformed into a `Message` object.

You can find `.log` files for flows at your Langflow installation's log storage location.
For filepaths, see [Log storage](#log-storage).

### View chat logs

In the **Playground**, you can inspect the chat history for each chat session.
For more information, see [View chat history](/concepts-playground#view-chat-history).

### View output from a single component

When debugging issues with the format or content of a flow's output, it can help to inspect each component's output to determine where data is being lost or malformed.

To view the output produced by a single component during the most recent run, click <Icon name="TextSearch" aria-hidden="true"/> **Inspect output** in the visual editor.
