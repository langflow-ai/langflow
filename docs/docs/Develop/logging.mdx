This page provides information about Langflow logs, including logs for individual flows and the Langflow application itself.

Langflow uses the [structlog](https://www.structlog.org) library for logging.

The default logfile is named `langflow.log`.
Langflow also produces logfiles for flows.

Log files are stored in JSON format with structured metadata.

## Log storage

Langflow logs are stored in the config directory specified in the `LANGFLOW_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable.
<PartialConfigDirPaths/>

To customize log storage, see [Configure log options](#configure-log-storage-options).

### Configure log storage options

Use [Langflow environment variables](/environment-variables) to configure logging options in your Langflow `.env` file, and then start Langflow with `uv run langflow run --env-file .env`.

The following environment variables are available to configure logging:

| Variable | Format | Default | Description |
|----------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `LANGFLOW_LOG_LEVEL` | String | `ERROR` | Sets the log level as one of `DEBUG`, `ERROR`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, and `CRITICAL`. For example, `LANGFLOW_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`. |
| `LANGFLOW_LOG_FILE` | String | Not set | Sets the log file storage location if you want to use a non-default location. For example, `LANGFLOW_LOG_FILE=path/to/logfile.log`. If this option isn't set, logs are written to stdout. |
| `LANGFLOW_LOG_ENV` | String | `default` | Controls how logs are formatted and displayed. `container`: JSON format for Docker/structured logging. `container_csv`: CSV format for data analysis. `default` or unset: Pretty, colorful format for development/reading using [RichHandler](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/logging.html). |
| `LANGFLOW_LOG_ROTATION` | String | `1 day` | Controls when the log file is rotated, either based on time or file size. Time-based rotation: "1 day", "12 hours", "1 week". Size-based rotation: "10 MB", "1 GB". Disable rotation: "None" (log files will grow without limit). |
| `LANGFLOW_LOG_RETRIEVER_BUFFER_SIZE` | Integer | `10000` | Set the buffer size for log retrieval. Only used if `LANGFLOW_ENABLE_LOG_RETRIEVAL` is enabled. |
| `LANGFLOW_LOG_FORMAT` | String | Not set | Set the log format configuration. |
| `LANGFLOW_PRETTY_LOGS` | Boolean | True | Enable pretty log formatting with colors and rich console output. |

## View logs in real-time

To monitor Langflow logs as they are generated, you can use the `tail -f` command to follow the log file:

1. Change to your [Langflow config directory](#log-storage):

    <Tabs groupId="cd-command">
      <TabItem value="macOS" label="macOS" default>

        ```bash
        cd /Users/**USERNAME**/Library/Caches/langflow
        ```

      </TabItem>
      <TabItem value="Windows" label="Windows">
        ```cmd
        cd C:\Users\**USERNAME**\AppData\Local\langflow\langflow\Cache
        ```

      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

2. Tail the main log file:

    <Tabs groupId="tail-command">
      <TabItem value="macOS" label="macOS" default>

        ```bash
        tail -f langflow.log
        ```

      </TabItem>
      <TabItem value="Windows" label="Windows">
        ```cmd
        Get-Content -Wait -Path langflow.log
        ```

      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>
    
    If you don't see new log entries, check that Langflow is running and generating logs. You can also check the terminal where you started Langflow to see if logs are being displayed there.
## Flow and component logs

After you run a flow, you can inspect the logs for the each component and flow run.
For example, you can inspect `Message` objects ingested and generated by [**Input and Output** components](/components-io).

### View flow logs

In the visual editor, click **Logs** to view logs for the entire flow:

![Logs pane](/img/logs.png)

Then, click the cells in the **inputs** and **outputs** columns to inspect the `Message` objects.
For example, the following `Message` data could be the output from a **Chat Input** component:

```text
    "messages": [
    {
        "message": "What's the recommended way to install Docker on Mac M1?",
        "sender": "User",
        "sender_name": "User",
        "session_id": "Session Apr 21, 17:37:04",
        "stream_url": null,
        "component_id": "ChatInput-4WKag",
        "files": [],
        "type": "text"
    }
    ],
```

In the case of Input/Output components, the original input might not be structured as a `Message` object.
For example, a **Language Model** component might pass a raw text response to a **Chat Output** component that is then transformed into a `Message` object.

You can find `.log` files for flows at your Langflow installation's log storage location.
For filepaths, see [Log storage](#log-storage).

### View chat logs

In the **Playground**, you can inspect the chat history for each chat session.
For more information, see [View chat history](/concepts-playground#view-chat-history).

### View output from a single component

When debugging issues with the format or content of a flow's output, it can help to inspect each component's output to determine where data is being lost or malformed.

To view the output produced by a single component during the most recent run, click <Icon name="TextSearch" aria-hidden="true"/> **Inspect output** on the component in the visual editor.

## Access Langflow Desktop logs {#desktop-logs}

If you encounter issues with Langflow Desktop, you might need to access startup logs for debugging.
Follow the steps for your operating system.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">

1. Open Terminal and run:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Library/Logs/com.Langflow
   ```

2. To open the folder and view the log files, run the command:
   ```bash
   open .
   ```

3. Locate the `langflow.log` file.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

1. Open the Command Prompt (CMD), and then run the following command:
   ```cmd
   cd %LOCALAPPDATA%\com.langflow\logs
   ```

2. To open the folder and view the log files, run the command:
   ```cmd
   start .
   ```

3. Locate the `langflow.log` file.
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can use the log file to investigate the issue on your own, add context to a [GitHub Issue](/contributing-github-issues), or send it to [support](/luna-for-langflow) for debugging assistance.

The log file is only created when Langflow Desktop runs. If you don't see a log file, try starting Langflow Desktop first, then check for the log file.
