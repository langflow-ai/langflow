  3. To apply the change, click **Confirm**.
  Langflow desktop restarts to install and activate the new version.

## Install and run Langflow with Docker {#install-and-run-langflow-docker}

You can use the [Langflow Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/langflowai/langflow) to run Langflow in an isolated environment.
Running applications in [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) containers ensures consistent behavior across different systems and eliminates dependency conflicts.

1. Install and start [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/).
2. Pull the latest [Langflow Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/langflowai/langflow) and start it:

  ```bash
  docker run -p 7860:7860 langflowai/langflow:latest
  ```

3. To access Langflow, navigate to `http://localhost:7860/`.

For more information, see [Deploy Langflow on Docker](/deployment-docker).

## Install and run the Langflow OSS Python package

To install and run Langflow OSS, you need the following:

- [Python 3.10 to 3.13](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/) for macOS/Linux, and Python 3.10 to 3.12 for Windows
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- At minimum, a dual-core CPU and 2 GB RAM, but a multi-core CPU and at least 4 GB RAM are recommended

1. Create a virtual environment with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/environments).

<details>
<summary>Need help with virtual environments?</summary>

Virtual environments ensure Langflow is installed in an isolated, fresh environment.
To create a new virtual environment, do the following.

<Tabs groupId="os">
  <TabItem value="macOS/Linux" label="macOS/Linux" default>
    1. Navigate to where you want your virtual environment to be created, and create it with `uv`.
Replace `VENV_NAME` with your preferred name for your virtual environment.
```
uv venv VENV_NAME
```
2. Start the virtual environment.
```
source VENV_NAME/bin/activate
```
Your shell's prompt changes to display that you're currently working in a virtual environment.
```
(VENV_NAME) ➜  langflow git:(main) ✗
```
3. To deactivate the virtual environment and return to your regular shell, type `deactivate`.
   When activated, the virtual environment temporarily modifies your PATH variable to prioritize packages installed within the virtual environment, so always deactivate it when you're done to avoid conflicts with other projects.
To delete the virtual environment, type `rm -rf VENV_NAME`.

2. To install Langflow, run the following command.

    ```bash
    uv pip install langflow
    ```

3. After installation, start Langflow:

    ```bash
    uv run langflow run
    ```

4. To confirm that a local Langflow instance is running, navigate to the default Langflow URL `http://127.0.0.1:7860`.
It can take a few minutes for Langflow to start.

After confirming that Langflow is running, create your first flow with the [Quickstart](/get-started-quickstart).

### Manage Langflow OSS versions

:::important
The Langflow team recommends installing new Langflow versions in a new virtual environment before upgrading your primary installation.

This allows you to [import flows](/concepts-flows#import-flow) from your existing installation and test them in the new version without disrupting your existing installation.
In the event of breaking changes or bugs, your existing installation is preserved in a stable state.
:::

To manage your Langflow OSS version, use the following commands:

* Upgrade Langflow to the latest version: `uv pip install langflow -U`
* Install a specific version of the Langflow package by adding the required version to the command, such as: `uv pip install langflow==1.3.2`
* Reinstall Langflow and all of its dependencies: `uv pip install langflow --force-reinstall`

### Manage Langflow OSS dependencies

Langflow OSS provides optional dependency groups and support for custom dependencies to extend Langflow functionality.
For more information, see [Install custom dependencies](/install-custom-dependencies).

## Troubleshoot Langflow installation and startup issues

If you encounter an issue when installing or running Langflow, see [Troubleshoot Langflow](/troubleshoot).

## Next steps

After installing Langflow, build and run a flow with the [quickstart](/get-started-quickstart).
