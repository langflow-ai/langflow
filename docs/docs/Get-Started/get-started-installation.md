Langflow can be installed in multiple ways:

* [**Langflow Desktop (Recommended)**](#install-and-run-langflow-desktop): Download and install the standalone desktop application for the least complicated setup experience.
This option includes dependency and version management.

* [**Docker**](#install-and-run-langflow-docker): Pull and run the Langflow Docker image to start a Langflow container and run Langflow in isolation.

* [**Python package**](#install-and-run-the-langflow-oss-python-package): Install and run the Langflow OSS Python package.
This option offers more control over the environment, dependencies, and versioning.

* [**Install from source**](/contributing-how-to-contribute#install-langflow-from-source): Use this option if you want to contribute to the Langflow codebase or documentation.

## Install and run Langflow Desktop

**Langflow Desktop** is a desktop version of Langflow that includes all the features of open source Langflow, with an additional [version management](#manage-your-version-of-langflow-desktop) feature for managing your Langflow version.

### Manage your version of Langflow Desktop

When a new version of Langflow is available, Langflow Desktop displays an upgrade message.

To manage your version of Langflow Desktop, follow these steps:

  1. In Langflow Desktop, click your profile image, and then select **Version Management**.
  The **Version Management** pane lists your active Langflow version first, followed by other available versions.
  The **latest** version is always highlighted.
  2. To change your Langflow version, select another version.
  A confirmation pane containing the selected version's changelog appears.
  3. To apply the change, click **Confirm**.
  Langflow desktop restarts to install and activate the new version.

## Install and run Langflow with Docker {#install-and-run-langflow-docker}

You can use the Langflow Docker image to start a Langflow container.
For more information, see [Deploy Langflow on Docker](/deployment-docker).

1. Install and start [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/).

2. Pull the latest [Langflow Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/langflowai/langflow) and start it:

    ```bash
    docker run -p 7860:7860 langflowai/langflow:latest
    ```

3. To access Langflow, navigate to `http://localhost:7860/`.

4. Create your first flow with the [Quickstart](/get-started-quickstart).

## Install and run the Langflow OSS Python package

1. Make sure you have the required dependencies and infrastructure:

    - [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/)
       - macOS and Linux: Version 3.10 to 3.13
       - Windows: Version 3.10 to 3.12
    - [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
    - Sufficient infrastructure:
       - Minimum: Dual-core CPU and 2 GB RAM
       - Recommended: Multi-core CPU and at least 4 GB RAM

2. Create a virtual environment with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/environments).

<summary>Need help with virtual environments?</summary>

Virtual environments ensure Langflow is installed in an isolated, fresh environment.
To create a new virtual environment, do the following.

<Tabs groupId="os">
  <TabItem value="macOS/Linux" label="macOS/Linux" default>
    1. Navigate to where you want your virtual environment to be created, and create it with `uv`.
Replace `VENV_NAME` with your preferred name for your virtual environment.
```
uv venv VENV_NAME
```
2. Start the virtual environment.
```
source VENV_NAME/bin/activate
```
Your shell's prompt changes to display that you're currently working in a virtual environment.
```
(VENV_NAME) ➜  langflow git:(main) ✗
```
3. To deactivate the virtual environment and return to your regular shell, type `deactivate`.
   When activated, the virtual environment temporarily modifies your PATH variable to prioritize packages installed within the virtual environment, so always deactivate it when you're done to avoid conflicts with other projects.
To delete the virtual environment, type `rm -rf VENV_NAME`.

To delete the virtual environment, type `Remove-Item VENV_NAME`.
  </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

</details>

3. In your virtual environment, install Langflow:

    ```bash
    uv pip install langflow
    ```

4. Start Langflow:

    ```bash
    uv run langflow run
    ```

    It can take a few minutes for Langflow to start.

5. To confirm that a local Langflow instance is running, navigate to the default Langflow URL `http://127.0.0.1:7860`.

6. Create your first flow with the [Quickstart](/get-started-quickstart).

### Manage Langflow OSS versions

:::important
The Langflow team recommends installing new Langflow versions in a new virtual environment before upgrading your primary installation.

This allows you to [import flows](/concepts-flows-import#import-a-flow) from your existing installation and test them in the new version without disrupting your existing installation.
In the event of breaking changes or bugs, your existing installation is preserved in a stable state.
:::

To manage your Langflow OSS version, use the following commands:

* Upgrade Langflow to the latest version: `uv pip install langflow -U`
* Install a specific version of the Langflow package by adding the required version to the command, such as: `uv pip install langflow==1.3.2`
* Reinstall Langflow and all of its dependencies: `uv pip install langflow --force-reinstall`

### Manage Langflow OSS dependencies

Langflow OSS provides optional dependency groups and support for custom dependencies to extend Langflow functionality.
For more information, see [Install custom dependencies](/install-custom-dependencies).
