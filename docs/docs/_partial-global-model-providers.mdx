To configure your model providers globally, do the following:

1. To open the **Model providers** pane, click <Icon name="BrainCog" aria-hidden="true" /> **Models** in the Langflow header.
2. In the **Model providers** pane, select a provider from the list.
3. In the **API Key** field, add your provider's API key.
4. Toggle on the specific models you want to enable from the list of available models for that provider.
Models are grouped into **LLM Models** and **Embedding Models** sections.
If a provider doesn't have any language models available, they aren't listed in the Agent component.

Models are now configured globally and available to all components in your flows.
