To edit Langflow's global model provider configuration, do the following:

1. Click <Icon name="BrainCog" aria-hidden="true" /> **Models** in the Langflow header.
2. In the **Model providers** pane, select a provider.
3. In the **API Key** field, add your provider's API key.

    The key must have permission to call the models you want to use in your flow, and your account must have sufficient credits for the actions you want to perform.
    
    You can only add one key for each provider. Make sure the key has access to _all_ models that you want to use in Langflow.
4. Enable the specific models that you want to use in Langflow.
The available models depends on the provider and your API key's permissions.
Models that generate text are listed under **LLM Models**.
Models that generate embeddings are listed under **Embedding Models**.

After you enable a model in Langflow's global model configuration, you can use that model in any model-driven component in your flows.
