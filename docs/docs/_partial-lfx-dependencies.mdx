If you already have Langflow installed, or if you're running from source at `src/lfx`, LFX is included with Langflow and all dependencies are already available. You don't need to install additional dependencies.

If you install the standalone `lfx` package from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/lfx/) or run LFX with `uvx`, you need to manually install the dependencies required by the components in your flow.  Check your flow's components to determine which dependencies are needed. For example, to run the simple agent template flow, install these dependencies in your environment before running the simple agent flow:
    ```bash
    uv pip install "langchain~=0.3.23" "langchain-core<1.0.0" "langchain-community" "langchain-openai" "langchain-text-splitters" beautifulsoup4 lxml requests
    ```
