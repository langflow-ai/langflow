# 📝 Guidelines

## Node
During the flow creation process, you will notice a colored circle <span style="color:green">o</span>. Components marked with a red asterisk <span style="color:red">*</span> must be connected. If you don't connect it, a red line will appear around it. Make the necessary connections to make your flow work. Hovering over the small circle will reveal the component that needs to be connected.

In some nodes, at the top of it, you will see a small gear icon ⚙️, which you can click to edit the component's parameters. You also have the option to delete it by clicking the trash can icon 🗑️.

## Import and Export
Flows can be exported and imported as JSON files. We already have some examples on **Import** option, check them out.

The **Export** option allows you to export your flow setting a name and description. You have the option to save the file with your API keys.

The background color can be set to light ☀️ or dark 🌙. The bell icon 🔔 indicates that the component has a notification.

## Chatbot
A chat icon 💬 located in the bottom right corner of the screen allows you to chat with a bot. When you click over 💬 a new screen will pop up. You can start a conversation with the bot by typing in the text box and pressing enter. The bot will respond to your message. In the top right corner of the screen, you will see an eraser icon ![Eraser](img/eraser.png#only-light){width=2.5%} ![Eraser](img/eraser2.png#only-dark){width=2.5%}. Clicking on it will clear the chat history.
