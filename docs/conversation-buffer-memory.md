`ConversationBufferMemory` allows you to store messages and then extract the messages in a variable. The **memory key** input is typically generated by encoding the input text using an encoder network, which maps the input text into a fixed-dimensional vector representation.

`ConversationChain` is a chain to have a conversation and load context from memory. **Output Key** and **Input Key** are simply unique identifiers used to represent the data being passed between different modules or steps in a Conversation Chain. These keys help to ensure that the data is properly routed and processed by the appropriate modules in the conversation flow.

Output Key used the default: ``` response ``` and Input Key used the default: ``` input ```.

In the LangFlow example, we used `ChatOpenAI` as the LLM, but you can use any LLM that has an API. Make sure to get the API key from the LLM provider. For example, [ChatOpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/){.internal-link target=_blank} requires you to create an account to get your API key.

Check out the [ChatOpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction/overview){.internal-link target=_blank} documentation to learn more about the API and the options that contain in the node.
