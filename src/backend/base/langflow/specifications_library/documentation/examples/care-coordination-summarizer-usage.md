# Care Coordination Summarizer Agent - Usage Guide

## Overview

The **Care Coordination Summarizer Agent** is a sophisticated multi-agent system designed to streamline transitions of care by automatically generating comprehensive referral packets and discharge summaries. It consolidates structured and unstructured data from multiple healthcare providers and systems to ensure seamless care continuity across settings.

## Specification Details

- **File**: `agents/provider-enablement/care-coordination-summarizer-agent.yaml`
- **Type**: Multi-Agent CrewAI Sequential Workflow
- **Complexity**: Advanced (16 components)
- **Pattern**: Multi-Agent Workflow with Sequential Crew Coordination

## Architecture

### Multi-Agent Workflow
The system operates through four specialized agents working in sequence:

1. **Data Collection Agent** - Gathers comprehensive patient data from multiple healthcare sources
2. **Clinical Summarization Agent** - Processes and synthesizes clinical information using NLP
3. **Template Generation Agent** - Creates formatted referral packets and discharge summaries
4. **Quality Assurance Agent** - Validates completeness, accuracy, and compliance

### Component Flow
```
Care Request Input → Data Collection Agent → Clinical Summarization Agent →
Template Generation Agent → Quality Assurance Agent → Summary Output
```

## Key Features

- **Data Harmonization**: Deduplication and standardization across sources
- **FHIR/HL7 Integration**: Standards-based interoperability
- **Clinical Summarization**: Evidence-based synthesis of complex medical data
- **Template Management**: Customizable formats for different care transitions

### **Quality Assurance & Compliance**
- **Clinical Accuracy Validation**: Medical terminology and care protocol verification
