# Medication Adherence Coach Agent - Usage Guide

## Overview

The **Medication Adherence Coach Agent** is a sophisticated multi-agent system designed to improve medication adherence through personalized, data-driven interventions. It combines pharmacy claims analysis, care plan review, risk assessment, and targeted communication to reduce medication non-adherence rates and improve patient outcomes.

## Specification Details

- **File**: `agents/patient-experience/medication-adherence-coach-agent.yaml`
- **Type**: Multi-Agent CrewAI Sequential Workflow
- **Complexity**: Advanced (14 components)
- **Pattern**: Multi-Agent Workflow with Sequential Crew Coordination

## Architecture

### Multi-Agent Workflow
The system operates through four specialized agents working in sequence:

1. **Data Collection Agent** - Gathers comprehensive medication and patient data
2. **Risk Assessment Agent** - Analyzes adherence patterns and calculates risk scores
3. **Communication Agent** - Generates personalized interventions and reminders
4. **Analytics Agent** - Tracks KPIs and provides performance insights

### Component Flow
```
Patient Input → Data Collection Agent → Risk Assessment Agent →
Communication Agent → Analytics Agent → Results Output
```

## Key Features

### **Data Integration**
- **Pharmacy Claims (NCPDP)**: Fill history, refill patterns, medication details
- **EHR Care Plans**: Clinical protocols, prescribed regimens, health status
- **Member Management**: Demographics, preferences, communication history

### **AI-Powered Analysis**
- **PDC Calculations**: Proportion of Days Covered for each medication
- **Risk Stratification**: Low/medium/high risk classification
- **Pattern Recognition**: Adherence gaps and refill behavior analysis
- **Patient Segmentation**: Targeted intervention strategies

### **Personalized Communication**
- **Multi-Channel Delivery**: Email, SMS, patient portal
- **Health Literacy Adaptation**: Appropriate messaging complexity
- **Barrier-Specific Solutions**: Cost, access, complexity interventions
- **Motivational Messaging**: Behavior change techniques

## Configuration Variables

| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `adherence_threshold` | float | 0.8 | PDC threshold for non-adherence classification |
| `reminder_frequency_days` | integer | 7 | Days between reminder communications |
| `risk_assessment_window_days` | integer | 90 | Lookback period for adherence analysis |
| `communication_channels` | string | "email,sms,portal" | Available communication channels |

## Sample Usage

### Input Example

{
  "patient_id": "PAT123456",
  "chronic_conditions": ["diabetes", "hypertension", "hyperlipidemia"],
  "preferred_communication": "email",
  "pharmacy_network": "CVS"
}
```

### Expected Output
```json
{
  "adherence_score": 0.65,
  "risk_level": "high",
  "interventions_sent": 3,
  "next_reminder_date": "2024-01-15",
  "adherence_gaps": ["metformin", "lisinopril"],
  "kpi_metrics": {
    "pdc_scores": {
      "metformin": 0.60,
      "lisinopril": 0.45,
      "atorvastatin": 0.85
    },
    "engagement_rate": 0.75,
    "intervention_conversion": 0.40
  }
}
```

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

| KPI | Target | Measurement |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| **Adherence Rate (PDC)** | > 80% | Proportion of Days Covered |
| **Refill Gap Closure Rate** | > 70% | Percentage of gaps closed |
| **Patient Engagement Rate** | > 60% | Response to interventions |
| **Intervention Conversion Rate** | > 40% | Adherence improvement |
| **Readmission Reduction** | > 15% | Decreased medication-related readmissions |
