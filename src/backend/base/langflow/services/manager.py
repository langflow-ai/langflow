"""Singleton service registry with dependency injection for Langflow services.

This module implements the ServiceManager which acts as a service registry
and factory orchestrator, providing dependency injection and ensuring
single instances of services across the application.

Service Registration:
    Services are automatically discovered and registered via ServiceFactory
    instances. Each service factory declares its dependencies through type hints:

    ```python
    class AuthService(Service):
        def __init__(self, settings_service: SettingsService): ...

    # Factory automatically infers SettingsService dependency
    ```

Dependency Resolution:
    The manager resolves dependencies recursively, creating services in
    dependency order. Circular dependencies are detected and raise errors.

Thread Safety:
    Uses KeyedMemoryLockManager to ensure thread-safe service creation:
    - Each service name gets its own lock during creation
    - Prevents race conditions in multi-threaded service initialization
    - Services are cached after creation for singleton behavior

Service Lifecycle:
    1. register_factories(): Auto-discover service factories
    2. get(service_name): Get or create service instance
    3. _create_service(): Instantiate with resolved dependencies
    4. Cached in self.services dict for subsequent requests

Key Components:
    - services: dict[str, Service] - Singleton service instances
    - factories: dict[str, ServiceFactory] - Service creation factories
    - keyed_lock: KeyedMemoryLockManager - Thread-safe creation locks

Factory Discovery:
    Automatically scans for ServiceFactory subclasses in:
    - langflow.services.*.factory modules
    - Each factory defines create() method for service instantiation
    - Dependencies resolved through constructor type annotations

Example Usage:
    ```python
    # Get service instance (creates if not exists)
    manager = get_service_manager()
    auth_service = manager.get(AUTH_SERVICE)

    # Services are singletons - same instance returned
    auth_service2 = manager.get(AUTH_SERVICE)
    assert auth_service is auth_service2
    ```

Supported Services:
    - AUTH_SERVICE: Authentication and user management
    - SETTINGS_SERVICE: Configuration and environment settings
    - DATABASE_SERVICE: Database connections and migrations
    - CHAT_SERVICE: Graph caching and execution state
    - TELEMETRY_SERVICE: Usage analytics and monitoring

The manager ensures proper initialization order and prevents circular
dependency issues through topological sorting of service dependencies.

Example Advanced Usage:
    ```python
    manager = ServiceManager()
    auth_service = manager.get("auth_service")  # Creates with dependencies
    database_service = manager.get("database_service")  # Reuses existing
    ```

The manager ensures consistent service instantiation and prevents duplicate
service creation across the Langflow application.
