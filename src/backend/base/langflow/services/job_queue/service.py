    """Asynchronous service for managing job-specific queues and their associated tasks.

    This service allows clients to:
      - Create dedicated asyncio queues for individual jobs.
      - Associate each queue with an EventManager, enabling event-driven handling.
      - Launch and manage asynchronous tasks that process these job queues.
      - Safely clean up resources by cancelling active tasks and emptying queues.
      - Automatically perform periodic cleanup of inactive or completed job queues.

    Attributes:
        name (str): Unique identifier for the service.
        _queues (dict[str, tuple[asyncio.Queue, EventManager, asyncio.Task | None]]):
            Dictionary mapping job IDs to a tuple containing:
              * The job's asyncio.Queue instance.
              * The associated EventManager instance.
              * The asyncio.Task processing the job (if any).
        _cleanup_task (asyncio.Task | None): Background task for periodic cleanup.
        _closed (bool): Flag indicating whether the service is currently active.

    Example:
        service = JobQueueService()
        await service.start()
        queue, event_manager = service.create_queue("job123")
        service.start_job("job123", some_async_coroutine())
