"""Main API router configuration for Langflow.

This module configures the FastAPI router hierarchy for Langflow's REST API,
organizing endpoints into versioned API groups (v1, v2) and functional modules.

The router handles:
- API versioning and route organization
- Import and registration of endpoint modules
- Prefix configuration for API namespacing
- Integration of specialized routers (voice, files, auth, etc.)

This provides the central routing configuration that FastAPI uses to
dispatch incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate handler functions.
