"""Utility helpers for providing actionable suggestions based on error messages.

This module groups together a few small helpers that attempt to recognise
common error patterns so that the caller can attach concrete and helpful
troubleshooting guidance to API error responses.

These helpers purposefully avoid pulling in heavy dependencies.  A couple of
simple ``in`` string checks cover the vast majority of user-facing scenarios
we want to handle here.

The module currently exposes two public helper functions:

    * ``get_connection_error_suggestions`` - Suggestions for network/connection
      failures (timeouts, refused connection, command-not-found, â€¦)
    * ``get_validation_error_suggestions`` - Suggestions for configuration /
      validation problems detected locally before any network I/O happens.

Both helpers return a *list[str]* so that callers can directly marshal the
result into JSON responses.
