# LangFlow Demo Codespace Readme

These instructions will walk you through the process of running a LangFlow demo via GitHub Codespaces.

## Setup

### Create a Codespace in GitHub

To setup the demo, simply navigate to the Langflow repo, click the "+" button, and select "Create new Codespace". This will automatically create a new codespace in your browser, which you can use for the demo.

### Wait for everything to install

After the codespace is opened, you should see a new Terminal window in VS Code where langflow is installed. Once the install completes, `langflow` will launch the webserver and your application will be available via devcontainer port. 

Note: VS Code should prompt you with a button to push once the port is available.
