# Response for Issue #9465: Component Fails to Send Image Data to Multimodal Models

Hi @kcpan-glitch,

Thank you for reporting this issue with multimodal input for gpt-4o-mini. I've investigated the root cause and can provide you with both an explanation and workarounds.

## Root Cause Confirmed

The issue stems from **inconsistent format handling** in how Langflow constructs image content for the OpenAI API. I've identified multiple format mismatches in the codebase:

### 1. Image.to_content_dict() Method Issue
Located in `src/backend/base/langflow/schema/image.py:61-65`:
```python
def to_content_dict(self):
    return {
        "type": "image_url",
        "image_url": self.to_base64(),  # Returns direct base64 string
    }
```

**Problem**: Returns the base64 string directly instead of nested structure.

### 2. create_image_content_dict() Function Issue
Located in `src/backend/base/langflow/utils/image.py:74-102`:
```python
return {
    "type": "image",  # Wrong type for OpenAI
    "source_type": "url",
    "url": f"data:{mime_type};base64,{base64_data}"
}
```

**Problem**: Uses `"type": "image"` instead of `"type": "image_url"`.

### 3. What OpenAI Actually Expects
```json
{
  "type": "image_url",
  "image_url": {
    "url": "data:image/jpeg;base64,{base64_string}"
  }
}
```

The missing nested structure in `image_url` and incorrect type values cause the OpenAI API to ignore the image data, leading to text-only processing.

## Affected Components

- **Message.get_file_content_dicts()** in `src/backend/base/langflow/schema/message.py:205-209`
- **Agent.process_inputs()** in `src/backend/base/langflow/base/agents/agent.py:150-158`
- Any component using OpenAI vision models (gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4-vision-preview)

## Immediate Workarounds

While waiting for an official fix:

1. **Use alternative vision components** like JigsawStack or Claude models which may handle images differently
2. **Pre-process images** to base64 and manually construct the correct format if using the API directly
3. **Monitor PR #9092** which aims to add image input support to LCModelComponent

## Technical Solution Required

The fix requires updating both:
1. `Image.to_content_dict()` method to return the properly nested structure
2. `create_image_content_dict()` function to use correct type and structure
3. Ensuring consistent format across all multimodal components

## Related Issues

- Issue #7884 (OpenAI GPT vision support) - Still open and related to this problem
- PR #9092 (Image input support for LCModelComponent) - Currently in development

## Next Steps

This is a confirmed bug in Langflow's multimodal handling. The development team needs to standardize the image format across all components to match OpenAI's API requirements.

Thank you for the detailed reproduction steps - they were invaluable for identifying the exact cause!

Best regards,
Langflow Support
