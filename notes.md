# Notes for Cache Normalization Implementation

## Summary
- Implemented an upper-layer cache normalization strategy to ensure backends (memory, disk, Redis) only persist stable DTOs, avoiding serialization of dynamic classes/functions and runtime-only objects.
- Integrated normalization into ChatService before writing to caches and added compatibility on Graph cache restore for normalized vertex snapshots.
- Added unit tests for normalizer and ChatService cache behavior; added a local script to perform sanity checks without full test infrastructure.

## Files Changed / Added

- cache_solution.md
  - Design document describing the normalization strategy, envelope shape, compatibility, and migration plan.

- src/lfx/src/lfx/serialization/normalizer.py
  - New module containing `normalize_for_cache(obj)` which converts arbitrary objects into cache-safe DTOs.
  - Handles classes, functions, Pydantic models, generators, containers, vertex-like snapshots, and unknown complex objects.

- src/backend/base/langflow/services/chat/service.py
  - `set_cache`: now normalizes `data` via `normalize_for_cache` and stores an envelope with `type="normalized"` and `__envelope_version__=1`.

- src/lfx/src/lfx/graph/graph/base.py
  - Cache read path enhanced to detect normalized vertex snapshots (`__cache_vertex__=True`) and restore a safe `UnbuiltObject()` placeholder when `built_object` contains a cache placeholder. Falls back to the previous behavior for legacy shapes.

- src/backend/tests/unit/cache/test_normalizer.py
  - Tests normalization of dynamic classes/functions, Pydantic models, and vertex-like snapshots.

- src/backend/tests/unit/cache/test_chatservice_cache.py
  - Tests that ChatService writes normalized payloads (including vertex placeholders) into cache.

- scripts/run_local_cache_checks.py
  - Ad-hoc local validation script to exercise normalization and ChatService caching in environments without full test dependencies.

## Validation Performed

- Pytest is not available in this sandbox (and external dependencies like numpy/orjson/structlog are missing), so full test execution is not possible here.
- Executed a local sanity script `scripts/run_local_cache_checks.py` which validates normalization logic in isolation and simulates ChatService caching with a fake cache, using module shims to bypass heavy optional dependencies.
- In a proper dev environment with pytest and dependencies installed, run:
  - `pytest -q src/backend/tests/unit/cache/test_normalizer.py src/backend/tests/unit/cache/test_chatservice_cache.py`

## Backward Compatibility & Risk

- Backends store normalized dicts; memory/disk caches already accept dict/bytes; Redis benefits by avoiding dill recursion issues.
- Graph restore supports both normalized and legacy cached shapes; no breaking change expected.
- Redis-layer dill-based sanitization remains as a fallback but should be rarely needed now.

## Next Steps (Optional)
- Consider moving all cache envelopes to a strict JSON/MsgPack serializer for portability once broader test coverage confirms stability.
- Add component-level cache policies (`RESULT_ONLY`, `ARTIFACTS_BY_REF`, `DISABLED`, `CUSTOM`).
- Add metrics for cache hit rate and normalization drop reasons.
