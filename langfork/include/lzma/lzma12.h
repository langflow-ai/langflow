 * \brief       LZMA1 Filter ID with extended options (for raw encoder/decoder)
 *
 * This is like LZMA_FILTER_LZMA1 but with this ID a few extra options
 * are supported in the lzma_options_lzma structure:
 *
 *   - A flag to tell the encoder if the end of payload marker (EOPM) alias
 *     end of stream (EOS) marker must be written at the end of the stream.
 *     In contrast, LZMA_FILTER_LZMA1 always writes the end marker.
 *
 *   - Decoder needs to be told the uncompressed size of the stream
 *     or that it is unknown (using the special value UINT64_MAX).
 *     If the size is known, a flag can be set to allow the presence of
 *     the end marker anyway. In contrast, LZMA_FILTER_LZMA1 always
 *     behaves as if the uncompressed size was unknown.
 *
 * This allows handling file formats where LZMA1 streams are used but where
 * the end marker isn't allowed or where it might not (always) be present.
 * This extended LZMA1 functionality is provided as a Filter ID for raw
 * encoder and decoder instead of adding new encoder and decoder initialization
 * functions because this way it is possible to also use extra filters,
 * for example, LZMA_FILTER_X86 in a filter chain with LZMA_FILTER_LZMA1EXT,
 * which might be needed to handle some file formats.
