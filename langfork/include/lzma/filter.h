/**
 * \brief       Convert a string to a filter chain
 *
 * This tries to make it easier to write applications that allow users
 * to set custom compression options. This only handles the filter
 * configuration (including presets) but not the number of threads,
 * block size, check type, or memory limits.
 *
 * The input string can be either a preset or a filter chain. Presets
 * begin with a digit 0-9 and may be followed by zero or more flags
 * which are lower-case letters. Currently only "e" is supported, matching
 * LZMA_PRESET_EXTREME. For partial xz command line syntax compatibility,
 * a preset string may start with a single dash "-".
 *
 * A filter chain consists of one or more "filtername:opt1=value1,opt2=value2"
 * strings separated by one or more spaces. Leading and trailing spaces are
 * ignored. All names and values must be lower-case. Extra commas in the
 * option list are ignored. The order of filters is significant: when
 * encoding, the uncompressed input data goes to the leftmost filter first.
 * Normally "lzma2" is the last filter in the chain.
 *
 * If one wishes to avoid spaces, for example, to avoid shell quoting,
 * it is possible to use two dashes "--" instead of spaces to separate
 * the filters.
 *
 * For xz command line compatibility, each filter may be prefixed with
 * two dashes "--" and the colon ":" separating the filter name from
 * the options may be replaced with an equals sign "=".
 *
 * By default, only filters that can be used in the .xz format are accepted.
 * To allow all filters (LZMA1) use the flag LZMA_STR_ALL_FILTERS.
 *
 * By default, very basic validation is done for the filter chain as a whole,
 * for example, that LZMA2 is only used as the last filter in the chain.
 * The validation isn't perfect though and it's possible that this function
 * succeeds but using the filter chain for encoding or decoding will still
 * result in LZMA_OPTIONS_ERROR. To disable this validation, use the flag
 * LZMA_STR_NO_VALIDATION.
 *
 * The available filter names and their options are available via
 * lzma_str_list_filters(). See the xz man page for the description
 * of filter names and options.
 *
 * For command line applications, below is an example how an error message
 * can be displayed. Note the use of an empty string for the field width.
 * If "^" was used there it would create an off-by-one error except at
 * the very beginning of the line.
 *
 * \code{.c}
 * const char *str = ...; // From user
 * lzma_filter filters[LZMA_FILTERS_MAX + 1];
 * int pos;
 * const char *msg = lzma_str_to_filters(str, &pos, filters, 0, NULL);
 * if (msg != NULL) {
 *     printf("%s: Error in XZ compression options:\n", argv[0]);
 *     printf("%s: %s\n", argv[0], str);
 *     printf("%s: %*s^\n", argv[0], errpos, "");
 *     printf("%s: %s\n", argv[0], msg);
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * \param       str         User-supplied string describing a preset or
 *                          a filter chain. If a default value is needed and
 *                          you don't know what would be good, use "6" since
 *                          that is the default preset in xz too.
 * \param[out]  error_pos   If this isn't NULL, this value will be set on
 *                          both success and on all errors. This tells the
 *                          location of the error in the string. This is
 *                          an int to make it straightforward to use this
 *                          as printf() field width. The value is guaranteed
 *                          to be in the range [0, INT_MAX] even if strlen(str)
 *                          somehow was greater than INT_MAX.
 * \param[out]  filters     An array of lzma_filter structures. There must
 *                          be LZMA_FILTERS_MAX + 1 (that is, five) elements
 *                          in the array. The old contents are ignored so it
 *                          doesn't need to be initialized. This array is
 *                          modified only if this function returns NULL.
 *                          Once the allocated filter options are no longer
 *                          needed, lzma_filters_free() can be used to free the
 *                          options (it doesn't free the filters array itself).
 * \param       flags       Bitwise-or of zero or more of the flags
 *                          LZMA_STR_ALL_FILTERS and LZMA_STR_NO_VALIDATION.
 * \param       allocator   lzma_allocator for custom allocator functions.
 *                          Set to NULL to use malloc() and free().
 *

 *              error message is returned which together with the error_pos
 *              should give some idea what is wrong.
