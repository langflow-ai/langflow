# Response for Issue #4157: How to Enable SSL on Langflow

Hi @tejaspatil0407,

Thank you for your question about enabling SSL on a locally hosted Python version of Langflow. I need to provide you with accurate information about Langflow's SSL support, which has **important platform limitations**.

## ⚠️ SSL Support Status

**IMPORTANT**: Langflow's built-in SSL support is **incomplete** and has critical limitations:

- ✅ **Linux/macOS**: SSL works properly via Gunicorn
- ❌ **Windows**: SSL parameters are **ignored** - server runs on HTTP even when SSL certificates are provided

## Built-in SSL Support (Linux/macOS Only)

On Linux and macOS systems, you can enable SSL using either CLI parameters or environment variables:

### Method 1: Command Line Parameters
```bash
langflow run --ssl-cert-file-path /path/to/your/certificate.crt --ssl-key-file-path /path/to/your/private.key
```

### Method 2: Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in your project directory:
```bash
LANGFLOW_SSL_CERT_FILE=/path/to/your/certificate.crt
LANGFLOW_SSL_KEY_FILE=/path/to/your/private.key
```

Then run:
```bash
langflow run
```

## SSL Certificate Generation

### For Local Development (Self-Signed Certificate)
```bash
# Generate private key
openssl genrsa -out langflow.key 2048

# Generate self-signed certificate (valid for 365 days)
openssl req -new -x509 -key langflow.key -out langflow.crt -days 365 -subj "/C=US/ST=State/L=City/O=Organization/CN=localhost"
```

### Using the Generated Certificates
```bash
# Using CLI parameters
langflow run --ssl-cert-file-path langflow.crt --ssl-key-file-path langflow.key

# Or using environment variables
export LANGFLOW_SSL_CERT_FILE=langflow.crt
export LANGFLOW_SSL_KEY_FILE=langflow.key
langflow run
```

### For Production
- Use Let's Encrypt via Certbot for free certificates
- Purchase commercial SSL certificates from a trusted CA
- Use your organization's internal CA certificates

## How It Works (Linux/macOS)

When you provide SSL certificates on Linux/macOS, Langflow will:

1. **Detect SSL certificates** and switch protocol display to HTTPS
2. **Display** `https://localhost:7860` in the startup message
3. **Serve all content** over encrypted HTTPS connections via Gunicorn
4. **Use Gunicorn's SSL implementation** for production-grade security

## ❌ Windows Limitation

**Critical Issue**: On Windows systems, Langflow uses Uvicorn directly, and the SSL parameters are **not passed** to the server. Even if you configure SSL certificates:

- The banner will show `https://localhost:7860`
- **But the server actually runs on HTTP** (not HTTPS)
- SSL certificates are completely ignored
- This is a bug in the current implementation

## Recommended Solutions

### For Windows Users (Required)
Since built-in SSL doesn't work on Windows, use a reverse proxy:

### For Linux/macOS Users (Optional but recommended for production)
While built-in SSL works, reverse proxies offer additional benefits:

### Using nginx with SSL Termination
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    ssl_certificate /path/to/your/certificate.crt;
    ssl_private_key /path/to/your/private.key;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:7860;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

### Using Caddy (Automatic HTTPS)
Create a `Caddyfile`:
```
your-domain.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:7860
}
```

Caddy automatically handles SSL certificate generation and renewal.

## Troubleshooting

### Platform-Specific Issues
1. **Windows**: SSL configuration is ignored - use reverse proxy instead
2. **Linux/macOS Certificate issues**: Verify file paths are correct and files exist
3. **Permission denied**: Ensure Langflow process can read certificate files
4. **Self-signed certificate warnings**: Expected for development; browsers will show security warnings

### Verification
**Linux/macOS only** - After configuring SSL:
```bash
# Check HTTPS is working (should return data)
curl -k https://localhost:7860/health

# View certificate details
openssl x509 -in langflow.crt -text -noout
```

**Windows** - SSL verification will fail:
```bash
# This will fail on Windows even with SSL configured
curl -k https://localhost:7860/health

# Server actually runs on HTTP
curl http://localhost:7860/health
```

## Important Notes

- **Platform Dependency**: SSL only works on Linux/macOS due to implementation differences
- **Windows Users**: Must use reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, etc.) for SSL
- **File Permissions**: Ensure certificate files are readable by the Langflow process (Linux/macOS)
- **Port Configuration**: HTTPS typically uses port 443, but Langflow defaults to 7860
- **Firewall Rules**: Ensure your chosen port is accessible if needed
- **Development vs Production**: Self-signed certificates work for development but use proper CA-signed certificates for production

## Bug Report

This Windows SSL limitation appears to be a bug in the current Langflow implementation. The CLI accepts SSL parameters on all platforms, but only passes them to the server on Linux/macOS systems. Windows users may want to file a bug report or use the reverse proxy solutions above.

## Additional Resources

- [CLI Configuration Documentation](https://docs.langflow.org/configuration-cli) - Complete CLI parameter reference
- [Environment Variables Guide](https://docs.langflow.org/environment-variables) - All supported environment variables

**Bottom Line**: For reliable SSL support across all platforms, use a reverse proxy solution rather than relying on Langflow's incomplete built-in SSL implementation.
