# File Deletion Issue #9053 - Validated Response

## Issue Summary

**Reporter**: @DaimoniX  
**Issue**: Unable to delete uploaded files via UI and API  
**Version**: Langflow 1.5.0 via Docker  
**Date**: July 15, 2025  
**Regression**: Issue didn't occur in 1.4.x  

## Verification Results (2025-08-22)

### âœ… **100% VALIDATED SOLUTION**

All claims in the provided solution have been verified against the current codebase:

## Root Cause Analysis (Confirmed)

### Problematic Code Locations (Verified)

**File**: `/src/backend/base/langflow/api/v2/files.py`

1. **Single Delete** (Line 480):
   ```python
   await storage_service.delete_file(flow_id=str(current_user.id), file_name=file_to_delete.path)
   ```

2. **Batch Delete** (Line 282):
   ```python
   await storage_service.delete_file(flow_id=str(current_user.id), file_name=file.path)
   ```

3. **Delete All** (Line 512):
   ```python
   await storage_service.delete_file(flow_id=str(current_user.id), file_name=file.path)
   ```

### Why Downloads Work (Verified)

**Download Function** (Line 412) correctly extracts filename:
```python
file_name = file.path.split("/")[-1]
```

### Technical Issue

- **Storage expects**: Just the filename (e.g., `"document.pdf"`)
- **Delete functions pass**: Full path (e.g., `"user_id/document.pdf"`)
- **Result**: Storage service can't find file at incorrect path

## Fix Status (Confirmed)

### PR #9027 Details (Verified)

- **Title**: "fix: Extract filename from path for storage service delete operations"
- **Author**: @machimachida
- **Status**: **OPEN** (not merged)
- **Changes**: 3 additions, 3 deletions
- **Fix**: Apply `file.path.split("/")[-1]` to all delete operations

### Current Status

- **In Current Codebase**: Bug still exists (PR not merged)
- **Fix Available**: Yes, but pending merge
- **Timeline**: Waiting for PR review and merge

## Validated Response to User

Hi @DaimoniX,

Thank you for reporting this file deletion issue with Langflow 1.5.0. I've verified the exact cause and can confirm this is a known regression from version 1.4.x.

### Root Cause Analysis (Verified)

The issue is in the file deletion API endpoints in `src/backend/base/langflow/api/v2/files.py`. The problem occurs because:

1. **File storage path format**: When files are uploaded, they're stored with a path like `user_id/filename` in the database
2. **Incorrect parameter passing**: The deletion functions are passing the full path (`file.path`) to the storage service
3. **Storage service expects filename only**: The storage service expects just the filename, not the full path

**Specific problematic lines (verified):**
- Line 480: `await storage_service.delete_file(flow_id=str(current_user.id), file_name=file_to_delete.path)`
- Line 282: `await storage_service.delete_file(flow_id=str(current_user.id), file_name=file.path)` (batch delete)
- Line 512: `await storage_service.delete_file(flow_id=str(current_user.id), file_name=file.path)` (delete all)

**Why downloads work but deletes don't**: The download function correctly extracts the filename using `file.path.split("/")[-1]` (line 412), but the delete functions don't perform this extraction.

### Current Status (Verified)

This issue has been identified and fixed in [PR #9027](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow/pull/9027), but the fix has **not been merged yet**. The PR modifies the deletion functions to extract the filename from the path before passing it to the storage service, matching the approach used in the download function.

### Temporary Workaround

Unfortunately, there's no simple configuration-based workaround for this issue in Langflow 1.5.0. The files remain accessible for downloads and flow usage, but cannot be deleted through the UI or API until the fix is merged.

### Next Steps

1. **Monitor PR #9027** for when the fix gets merged
2. **Upgrade when available**: Once the fix is merged, upgrading to the new version will resolve this issue
3. **Database cleanup**: After the fix is applied, you may need to clean up any orphaned file records if needed

This regression specifically affects Langflow 1.5.0 and was not present in 1.4.x versions. The fix is straightforward and should be available in the next release.

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions about this issue.

Best regards,
