# Concise Task Management Protocol - Sequential Mode

## File Creation
- Filename: `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_task_name.md` 
- IMPORTANT: Always include a descriptive task name after the timestamp (e.g., `20250404_135621_api_integration.md`)
- Never create files with timestamp only
- Store in `tasks/` directory

## Task Structure

```
# Task: [Task Name]
**Status**: [Not Started | In Progress | Completed]

## Analysis
- [ ] Requirements
  - [ ] Subtask 1
- [ ] Challenges
- [ ] Dependencies

## Plan
- [ ] Step 1: [Description]
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1
- [ ] Step 2: [Description]

## Execution
- [ ] Implementation 1
  - [ ] Details
- [ ] Implementation 2
  - [ ] Files modified: [files]

## Summary
- [ ] Files modified: `filename.ext` (lines X-Y)
- [ ] Dependencies added/changed
- [ ] Edge cases considered
- [ ] Known limitations
- [ ] Future impact points
```

## Execution Rules
- Execute one subtask at a time in sequence
- Update the task file after EACH subtask is completed
- Mark completed subtasks with [x] as they are finished
- Update main task status throughout execution
- Document work incrementally, not all at once
- Never proceed to the next section until all subtasks in the current section are completed and marked
