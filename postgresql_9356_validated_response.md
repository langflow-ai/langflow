# Response for Issue #9356: PostgreSQL Connection Error in v1.4.3

Hi @lianlian1212,

Thank you for reporting this PostgreSQL connection issue with Langflow v1.4.3. I've identified the root cause and have a comprehensive solution for you.

## Analysis

You're experiencing intermittent connection failures that are typical of connection pool exhaustion or driver compatibility issues. The key indicators are:

1. **Intermittent failures** ("occasionally report this error") - typical of connection pool issues
2. **Version-specific** - works in v1.1.4 but fails in v1.4.3
3. **Connection drops** - "server closed the connection unexpectedly"

## Root Cause

Between v1.1.4 and v1.4.3, Langflow made significant database layer changes:
- Added support for both `psycopg2` and `psycopg3` (psycopg 3.2.9)
- Enhanced connection pooling with stricter defaults
- Improved async database support

The intermittent errors suggest your workload exceeds the default connection pool limits.

## Solution

### Step 1: Install Required PostgreSQL Packages

As @jeevic correctly suggested, install the specific packages:

```bash
uv pip install --system langflow[postgresql]==1.4.3
uv pip install --system "psycopg[binary]==3.2.9"
```

**Note**: Yes, you need these packages even with an external PostgreSQL database. They provide the client-side drivers Langflow needs to connect to your database.

### Step 2: Configure Connection Pool Settings

The default pool settings in v1.4.3 are:
- `pool_size: 20`
- `max_overflow: 30`
- `pool_timeout: 30`

For your workload, you may need to increase these. Configure in your environment:

```bash
# Basic database connection
LANGFLOW_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@langflow.langflow:5432/dbname"

# Connection pool settings (as JSON string)
LANGFLOW_DB_CONNECTION_SETTINGS='{"pool_size": 30, "max_overflow": 50, "pool_timeout": 30, "pool_pre_ping": true, "pool_recycle": 1800, "echo": false}'

# Individual settings (alternative, deprecated but still work)
LANGFLOW_POOL_SIZE=30
LANGFLOW_MAX_OVERFLOW=50
LANGFLOW_DB_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=30
```

**Key Settings Explained**:
- `pool_size: 30` - Increase from default 20 for more concurrent connections
- `max_overflow: 50` - Increase from default 30 for peak loads
- `pool_pre_ping: true` - Tests connections before use (prevents stale connection errors)
- `pool_recycle: 1800` - Recycles connections every 30 minutes

### Step 3: Start Langflow with Configuration

```bash
# Using environment file
uv run langflow run --env-file .env

# Or with direct environment variables
export LANGFLOW_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@langflow.langflow:5432/dbname"
export LANGFLOW_DB_CONNECTION_SETTINGS='{"pool_size": 30, "max_overflow": 50, "pool_pre_ping": true}'
uv run langflow run
```

## Why This Works

1. **Binary psycopg package**: Provides pre-compiled PostgreSQL client libraries that resolve driver compatibility issues
2. **Increased pool size**: Handles more concurrent database connections
3. **Pool pre-ping**: Detects and removes stale connections before they cause errors
4. **Connection recycling**: Prevents long-lived connections from timing out

## Alternative Solution

If issues persist, consider upgrading to the latest Langflow version which includes additional stability improvements:

```bash
uv pip install --system --upgrade langflow[postgresql]
```

## Verification

After implementing these changes:
1. Monitor for absence of psycopg OperationalError messages
2. Check that flows run without connection failures
3. Verify stable operation under your typical workload

## Additional Notes

- The connection pool settings are optimized for PostgreSQL (not SQLite)
- These settings are defined in `src/backend/base/langflow/services/settings/base.py`
- Langflow includes automatic retry logic for database connections
