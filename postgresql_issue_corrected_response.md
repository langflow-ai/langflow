# Response for PostgreSQL Connection Timeout Issue

Hi @lianlian1212,

Thank you for reporting this PostgreSQL connection timeout issue. Based on your error messages and Langflow v1.4.3 configuration, I can provide some immediate workarounds.

## Root Cause Analysis

You're experiencing **database connection pool exhaustion** in Langflow v1.4.3. This manifests as:
- `psycopg.errors.ProtocolViolation: query_wait_timeout` errors
- "Server is busy" messages in the UI
- SQLAlchemy operational errors

This is related to ongoing connection pool management challenges that can occur under high load or with certain usage patterns.

## Immediate Workarounds

### 1. Disable API Key Usage Tracking
Reduce database contention by adding this environment variable:
```bash
LANGFLOW_DISABLE_TRACK_APIKEY_USAGE=true
```

### 2. Optimize Connection Pool Settings
Configure your database connection pool:
```bash
LANGFLOW_DB_CONNECTION_SETTINGS='{"pool_size": 30, "max_overflow": 50, "pool_timeout": 60, "pool_pre_ping": true, "pool_recycle": 1800, "echo": false}'
```

**Parameter explanations:**
- `pool_size`: Maximum connections in pool (increased from default 20 to 30)
- `max_overflow`: Additional connections beyond pool_size (increased to 50)
- `pool_timeout`: Seconds to wait for connection (increased to 60)
- `pool_pre_ping`: Test connections before use (recommended: true)
- `pool_recycle`: Recycle connections after 30 minutes
- `echo`: Set to true for SQL debugging if needed

### 3. Set Connection Timeout
```bash
LANGFLOW_DB_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=30
```

## Implementation Steps

1. **Stop Langflow** if it's currently running
2. **Create or update your `.env` file** with the variables above:
   ```bash
   LANGFLOW_DISABLE_TRACK_APIKEY_USAGE=true
   LANGFLOW_DB_CONNECTION_SETTINGS='{"pool_size": 30, "max_overflow": 50, "pool_timeout": 60, "pool_pre_ping": true, "pool_recycle": 1800}'
   LANGFLOW_DB_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=30
   ```
3. **Restart Langflow** with your environment file:
   ```bash
   langflow run --env-file .env
   ```

## Monitoring

After implementing these changes, monitor your PostgreSQL connections:
```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname = 'your_langflow_db';
```

Check for long-running or idle connections:
```sql
SELECT pid, state, query_start, state_change 
FROM pg_stat_activity 
WHERE datname = 'your_langflow_db' 
AND state != 'active' 
ORDER BY query_start;
```

## Additional Considerations

- **Review your workload**: High concurrent requests may require further pool size adjustments
- **Check PostgreSQL logs**: Look for blocked queries or deadlocks
- **Consider upgrading**: Newer versions may have improved connection handling

These workarounds should help mitigate the timeout issues. If problems persist, please share:
- Your typical concurrent user/request load
- PostgreSQL connection limits (`SHOW max_connections;`)
- Any custom code or integrations you're using

Let me know if you need help with the configuration!
